As testament to their value as prime-time stars, Miss Ball and Arnaz signed an $8-million, no-cancellation, two-year contract with CBS in 1953 -- the largest in television history at the time and a figure scarcely any TV star can touch 36 years later.
Miss Ball, who had a heart attack and had throat surgery in 1988, underwent surgery at Cedars-Sinai on April 18 to replace her aorta and aortic valve and had been getting out of bed, eating and even walking around the room in recent days.
Her timing, wails and pratfalls had made the I Love Lucy show one of the most popular in television history.
