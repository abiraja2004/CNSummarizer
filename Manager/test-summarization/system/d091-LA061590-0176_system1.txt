Belmont Countys sheriffs Sgt.
Belmont County Sheriffs Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips said a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when water caved in the back wall.
A flash flood sent a wall of water 15 to 20 feet high rampaging through hill communities along the Ohio River, killing at least 10 people and leaving dozens missing, authorities said today.
Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River.
Youre talking miles and miles of country roads that havent been gotten to yet, she said.
