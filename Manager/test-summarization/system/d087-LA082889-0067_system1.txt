I felt good going into the race, but my legs just gave out, said Blockburger, who had the slowest 1,500 time and earned only 569 points in the final event.
Im in good condition and its not a problem to run either the steeplechase or the 10,000.

Sheldon Blockburger of the U.S. was third going into the last event.
