For a long time, John Major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of British people, who have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a high rate of unemployment.
Even some former Conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the Liberal Democrats.
Of course, this was a measure taken by Tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents, who resent the Tories, to vote for the Liberal Democrats rather than Labour.
Obviously, all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making John Major suffer an even greater defeat in the European Parliament elections scheduled for 9 June.
