The governor warned that though the flood danger had receded, the determination to fight possible further floods could not slacken, as this is just the beginning: the main flood season, which usually begins in late July and early August, has not yet arrived.
No breaches of major embankments or reservoirs were reported despite the most serious flood in a hundred years, effectively protecting the safety of the provincial capital, Guangzhou, and the Pearl (Zhujiang) River Delta.
According to him, 11 million people in the provinces nine cities and 55 counties were affected, and more than 200 people died in the natural disaster, with 189,000 rooms destroyed and 1.2 million hectares of crops ruined.
