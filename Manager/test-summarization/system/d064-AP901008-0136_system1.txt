Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonalds Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said it took two years to prepare for the restaurants opening and his ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.
Although Kentucky Fried Chicken has become popular, the average Chinese still regards a meal there as a treat, rather than a convenience, and McDonalds could face the same problems.
The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, where cooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd to gourmets.
Another U.S. fast food outlet, Kentucky Fried Chicken, opened a restaurant in Beijing in 1987, and it now has four outlets there.
