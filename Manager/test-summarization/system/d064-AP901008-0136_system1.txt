McDonalds hamburgers, fries and golden arches came to China on Monday when the fast-food chain opened its first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine.
A factory worker, who waited several hours before she was able to purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of its sweet taste - the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly used in traditional Chinese cooking.
Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonalds Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said it took two years to prepare for the restaurants opening and his ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.
The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, where cooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd to gourmets.
