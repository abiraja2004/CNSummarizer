The opening of a U.S. fast-food restaurant in China, where cooking has long been considered a culinary art, may seem odd to gourmets.
The 500-seat McDonalds restaurant in a three-story building is operated by McDonalds Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., a wholly owned subsidiary of McDonalds Hong Kong.
Daniel Ng, chairman of McDonalds Restaurant Shenzhen Ltd., said it took two years to prepare for the restaurants opening and his ambition now is to serve 10 million burgers a year.
A factory worker, who waited several hours before she was able to purchase her hamburger, said she liked it because of its sweet taste - the result of tomato ketchup, which is not commonly used in traditional Chinese cooking.
