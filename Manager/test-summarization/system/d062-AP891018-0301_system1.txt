Insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire, which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices, said Hugh Strawn, director of catastrophe services at the Property Loss Research Bureau in Schaumburg, Ill. Insurance companies attempted Wednesday to assess the amount of quake-related damages theyre likely to have to pay.
Most San Francisco-area homeowners may have to pay for damage from Tuesdays earthquake out of their own pockets, while insurance companies may reap long-term benefits from higher rates, industry spokesmen and analysts said Wednesday.
Insurers arent required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners, but the percentage of business property with the coverage is very high, industry spokesmen said.
