WORKERS AT KGHM, Polands copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the countrys pits in a major challenge to the governments economic policies.
The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent.
The industry is experiencing a coal glut with pit head, power station and export stocks amounting to some 12m tonnes, the equivalent of a months output.
In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the government moved to control the budget deficit.
