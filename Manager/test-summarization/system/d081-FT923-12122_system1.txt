Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last weeks scattered stoppages in some 15 of Polands 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford.
The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent.
In contrast to the copper industry, which continues to show a profit, coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in March as the government moved to control the budget deficit.
