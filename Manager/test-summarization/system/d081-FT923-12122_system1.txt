WORKERS AT KGHM, Polands copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the countrys pits in a major challenge to the governments economic policies.
The strike at KGHM in Lubin, western Poland, where mining unions representing some 40,0000 workers have been demanding a 30 per cent wage increase, came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by 20 per cent.
Meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last weeks scattered stoppages in some 15 of Polands 71 pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford.
