Since then, it has been widely rumored Mandela will be released by Christmas in a move to win strong international support for the South African government.
A representative of the African National Congress said Saturday the South African government may release black nationalist leader Nelson Mandela as early as Tuesday.
A South African government source last week indicated recent rumors of Mandelas impending release were orchestrated by members of the anti-apartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action.
There are very strong rumors in South Africa today that on Nov. 15 Nelson Mandela will be released, said Yusef Saloojee, chief representative in Canada for the ANC, which is fighting to end white-minority rule in South Africa.
