Major and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd both joined the race, but before the vote her aides spread the word that she was backing Major.
Six days later, with Mrs. Thatcher at a 34-nation summit in Paris officially ending the Cold War, Heseltine polled enough votes to deny her re-election as leader.
Majors victory ended a patient, four-year campaign by Heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party.
Mrs. Thatcher, ending 11{ years in power, intended to submit her resignation to Queen Elizabeth II on Wednesday morning, and Major would then be called to lead the government.
During his five-day campaign, Major had aaid he would review the poll tax, an unpopular local tax brought in by Mrs. Thatcher, but he gave no other hints of differing with her.
