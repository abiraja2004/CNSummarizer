At Parks College in Cahokia, Ill., eight miles south of East St. Louis, aircraft hangers were twisted and flattened and small aircraft tossed around the airport by high winds, the National Weather Service said.
Severe thunderstorms also developed over Alabama and South Carolina during the afternoon, and the weather service reported a tornado north of Greenwood, S.C. Other showers and thunderstorms, with locally heavy rain, were widely scattered along the northern Atlantic Coast.
Thunderstorms wreaked havoc across the middle Mississippi Valley and the Southeast on Wednesday with lethal tornadoes, wind up to 100 mph and hail up to the size of baseballs.
