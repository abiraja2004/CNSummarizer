After meeting with staff and advisers, Combest, who worked for then-Sen. Tower in the 1970s, issued a two-sentence statement supporting his fellow Texan.
As a member of Congress, I have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this countrys armed forces.
An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combests statement about Towers drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, like a ton of bricks and was a factor in Nunns opposition to the nomination.
The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends _ not Tower alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.
