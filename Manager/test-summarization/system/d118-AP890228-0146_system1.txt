Trudi Boyd, Combests administrative assistant, told the Post that Combest originally went to Nunn and Warner to tell them Tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol.
Rep. Larry Combest, R-Texas, issued a terse statement Tuesday supporting Defense-Secretary designate John Tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told Senate Armed Services Committee leaders that Tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting.
The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends _ not Tower alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.
