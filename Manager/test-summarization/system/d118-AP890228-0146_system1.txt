An unidentified congressional source told The Washington Post that Combests statement about Towers drinking habits in the 1970s came down on Sen. Sam Nunn, the committee chairman, like a ton of bricks and was a factor in Nunns opposition to the nomination.
The newspaper reported that Combest later gave a different story to the FBI, saying that Tower and a group of friends _ not Tower alone _ had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch.
The committee, now controlled by Democrats, voted 11-9 along party lines last Thursday to recommend the full Senate reject Towers nomination.
In my judgment, John Tower will be a superb secretary of defense, the statement said.
