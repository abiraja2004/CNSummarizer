The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them.
To put it another way: Of the 2,127,000 American who died that year, more than one in three died of heart disease.
The researchers concluded that perhaps 15 percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days.
All of these advances come at a time when public health experts are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good nutrition in lowering heart disease risk.
We have to know how to respond quickly, and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis, says Dr. Burton Sobel of Washington University in St. Louis, a pioneer in the testing of the clot-dissolvers.
