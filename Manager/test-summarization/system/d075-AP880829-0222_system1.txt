In the most recent report, doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clot-dissolving drug given within 24 hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack.
Progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without warning and cannot be defended against.
Early next year, the American Heart Association seal of approval will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk.
The study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks _ but also to prevent them.
