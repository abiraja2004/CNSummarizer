East Germany authorities on Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
East Germanys democratic government has changed its mind several times on whether to pursue charges against the aging members of the former hard-line regime that was toppled in last autumns pro-democracy protests.
The government announced in June that Honecker, Mielke and several border guards would be investigated on possible murder charges in connection with those deaths.
The murder charge could put Honecker behind bars for life, but his poor health makes prosecution questionable.
Last month, a medical panel ruled that Honecker was too ill to be jailed pending investigation but fit enough to be prosecuted.
