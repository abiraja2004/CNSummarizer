St. Cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither Eales nor any other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged.
John D. Eales of St. Cross Episcopal Church -- where McMartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals -- told the congregation during his sermon that, after much prayer and consultation, he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims.
But since 1985, the church has struggled to shake a McMartin pupils allegation during the preliminary hearing that, six years earlier, he and other students had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar of St. Cross.
