; The weather improved today as two helicopters from the U.S. Navy frigate Aubrey Fitch, which joined in the rescue effort on Sunday night, and a Navy P-3 submarine-chaser aircraft made their first daylight search runs, said Lt. Cmdr.
The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said.
Juan Jose Gaytan, a reporter at Radio Portena in Puerto Barrios, said the Justo Rufineo Barrios II ran out of fuel midway on a regular 16-mile run from the town Livingston, across the bay, to Puerto Barrios.
Three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over the stern in heavy seas, then capsized when it was hit by a big wave.
The news service said the passengers were 183 students and teachers from a high school and primary school in Qiongzhong County, who were going to take the ferry to visit a hydroelectric power station.
He said the death toll may never be known because some bodies probably were carried downstream 30 to 60 miles by the surging water.
