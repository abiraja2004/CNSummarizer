Sir Nicholas Lyell QC, the attorney-general, will attempt to stop the curtain rising on Maxwell: The Musical, the West End show chronicling the life and times of the late Robert Maxwell.
However, it is no more unprecedented, most lawyers say, than the prospect of the Maxwell brothers having to commute to their trial at the Old Bailey past a theatre advertising the story of their father as the musical review that will make you laugh, sing - and be angry.
Fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publishers sons, Kevin and Ian, have prompted Sir Nicholas to apply to the High Court on Monday for an injunction to halt the production.
