In West Germany, the Foreign Ministry said that it was sending tents, blankets, hospital equipment and cooking equipment to Iran.
The official Soviet news agency Tass reported that a professional lifesaving team from the Armenian capital of Yerevan flew Saturday to Iran.
Thousands of residents in the predominantly Moslem Soviet republic of Azerbaijan, which borders Iran, donated tons of flour, rice and tea, and contributed more than $500,000 to a special earthquake fund, Tass said.
Eight tons was being shipped Saturday and the government has chartered a jumbo jet to transport 100 tons of equipment Monday.
Iran, which has had no diplomatic ties with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.
