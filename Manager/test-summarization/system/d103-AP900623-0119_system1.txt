Jordan backed Iraq in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war, which ended with a cease-fire in August 1988, and at one point sent hundreds of Jordanian volunteers to fight alongside Iraqi soldiers.
In West Germany, the Foreign Ministry said that it was sending tents, blankets, hospital equipment and cooking equipment to Iran.
Eight tons was being shipped Saturday and the government has chartered a jumbo jet to transport 100 tons of equipment Monday.
Iran, which has had no diplomatic ties with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.
