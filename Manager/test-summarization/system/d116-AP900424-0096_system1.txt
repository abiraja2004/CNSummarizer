The telescope was supposed to be launched in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger accident delayed its deployment.
On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttles mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its own.
Less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle Discovery on Tuesday, the $1.5 billion telescope sent its first test radio signal.
On hand to watch the Discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the Hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
