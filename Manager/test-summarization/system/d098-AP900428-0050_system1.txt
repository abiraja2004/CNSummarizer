We are out of the safe-mode right now, said Steve Terry, a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope.
Terry said that even in the safe mode, one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to Earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly.
He said the telescope was running on a normal control-all mode, where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing.
Mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed 29 mph at touchdown.
It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.
