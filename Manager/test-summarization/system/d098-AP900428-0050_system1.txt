Engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data, which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed.
It will take another day before the $1.5 billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process, said Hubble deputy project manager Jean Olivier.
Its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the Hubble Space Telescope, said Bolden.
Shortly after 6 a.m. EDT, controllers at the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md., completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a 12-hour computer program to monitor Hubbles health.
