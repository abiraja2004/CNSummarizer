President Corazon Aquino today reversed a long-held policy and said she was willing to negotiate cease-fires with Communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged coup attempts.
Ramos, a member of the Cabinet committee, has been credited with crushing six coup attempts against Mrs. Aquino.
Mrs. Aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks, including her most outspoken critic, Sen. Juan Ponce Enrile.
Although no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts, the government has blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled Mrs. Aquino in coup attempts.
The Communist rebels have been waging a 21-year rebellion to establish a Marxist state.
