It was the first time in modern history an Arab nation had invaded another and taken over its government.
U.S. officials monitoring the situation had no reports of harm to U.S. citizens in Iraq, White House spokesman Roman Popadiuk said.
A Pentagon source said U.S. Navy ships were diverted to the region, but President Bush said the subject of intervention was not being discussed.
Diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the evacuation of nationals, and foreigners were asked to keep a low profile.
Foreigners reached by telephone said they watched from their windows or dived for cover as the invasion began.
