After years of delay and a last-minute snag, the Hubble Space Telescope was freed from the shuttle Discovery on Wednesday and, glinting in the sunlight, drifted into orbit on its 15-year search for new worlds.
The mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on Discovery forced the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before April 10s scheduled liftoff.
If all goes well, the crew will land Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif. NASA expects to release its first image from the telescope _ of an open star cluster in the constellation Carina _ on Tuesday.
