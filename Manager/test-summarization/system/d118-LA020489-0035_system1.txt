But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, who asked not to be identified, said Friday that the new allegation, if true, suggests that the former Texas senators drinking problem may be ongoing and that his confirmation remains in doubt.
The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 to 1985.
Army Times, another prominent defense community publication, says Tower is unsuited for the Defense Department post because of his work as a consultant to defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 1986.
On Thursday, the Armed Services Committee had been set to approve the Tower nomination, but Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) abruptly canceled the vote because of the new charges, which he referred immediately to FBI Director William S. Sessions.
