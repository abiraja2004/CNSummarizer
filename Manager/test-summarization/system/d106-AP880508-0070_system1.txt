Northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring Mandela on May 13, ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony.
This started out as something noble, something weve tried to have done for three years, said Ottinger.
The degree is to be accepted by South African Archbishop Desmond Tutu, who is scheduled to be in Boston for a benefit dinner.
Thats the message we wanted conveyed to students.
Some faculty members and students, including many blacks, have criticized the administrations plan for the event, saying no effort was made to include them.
