English-language newspapers published in Japan quickly began using the name Showa for Hirohito after his death, but it did not become truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor Akihito conducted a ceremony in which Showa became the late emperors posthumous name.
The obituary issued in English by the Foreign Press Center, which is supported by the Foreign Ministry, was headed His late Majesty The Emperor Hirohito.
To the rest of the world, he was known as Emperor Hirohito, but in Japan his given name was seldom used.
In Japanese he was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The Emperor.
In Japanese histories, he will be recorded as Emperor Showa, the name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 1926.
