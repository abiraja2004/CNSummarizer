English-language newspapers published in Japan quickly began using the name Showa for Hirohito after his death, but it did not become truly official until Jan. 31, when Emperor Akihito conducted a ceremony in which Showa became the late emperors posthumous name.
In Japanese he was simply called Tenno Heika, meaning His Majesty The Emperor.
A stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with the posthumous name and the dates of his death and burial.
It means Enlightened Peace, and has been succeeded by Heisei, or Achieving Peace, the name the government chose for the reign of Hirohitos son Akihito a few hours after the emperor died Jan. 7.
