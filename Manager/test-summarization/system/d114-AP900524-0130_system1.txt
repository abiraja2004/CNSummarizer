During her trip abroad, Ms. Bhutto said all her host countries agreed that India and Pakistan needed to find a lasting political settlement of the 43-year-old dispute.
She also said a neutral body should look into the charges made by both sides.
We cannot rule out the possibility of an armed conflict, but we do not believe war is inevitable, she told reporters.
Her remarks raised tensions further between India and Pakistan, which have been feuding over Indian-controlled Kashmir.
India is indulging in genocide, Ms. Bhutto said at a news conference Thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight Moslem countries in the Middle East and North Africa.
