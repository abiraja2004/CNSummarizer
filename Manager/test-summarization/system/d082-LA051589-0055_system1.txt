Soviet human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov said Sunday that his country is on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving.
The old centralized system is being dismantled, and that is right.
Speaking in Russian without notes, he said the new laws were supposed to take the place of measures used against dissidents like himself in the 1970s and 1980s.
Sakharov, who did not mention the name of President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, described as anti-democratic some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest, particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in Soviet Georgia earlier this year.
