In August, Deutsche Grammophon released in this country a 12-CD set of Bernstein recordings with the Vienna Philharmonic, Israel Philharmonic and L.A. Philharmonic.
However, most of the repertory will be from previously released recordings, including some made early in his career.
At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of The Bernstein Collection: We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD.
