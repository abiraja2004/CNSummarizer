At Sony Classical (formerly CBS Records) in New York City, Peter Munves, director of marketing, said this week that in January the company will begin its three-year release of The Bernstein Collection: We will release 75 CDs of Bernstein performances, including not only symphonic music by Beethoven and others, but also oratorio performances -- works by Haydn, and the Requiems by Berlioz and Verdi -- and other music never before released on CD.
In fact, the only new recordings will be out next month -- as originally scheduled, reported Karen Moody, vice president of Deutsche Grammophon.
