Thibodeaux said that during the series run he spent as much time with Miss Ball as with his own family in Lafayette.
I think the thing I remember most about Lucy was that she was very much in control of everything, said Thibodeaux, who began playing the drums at age 2, was a professional drummer at age 4 and is now drummer with David and the Giants, a Christian rock group.
She was old and, of course, I knew about the heart attack, so I was not shocked by her death, said Keith Thibodeaux, who at age 6 began playing Miss Balls drum-playing son on the comedy series that continues in syndication around the world.
