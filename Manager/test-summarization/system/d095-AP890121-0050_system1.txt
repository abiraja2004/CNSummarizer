At Cleveland School, about three-quarters of the schools 970 pupils had returned to classes by Friday, about three times the number who attended Wednesday, but it was anything but a routine school day.
One mother, who asked not to be identified, told reporters that her youngest son, a 7-year-old second grader who was on playground when the shootings occurred, would only come back to school if she stayed with him.
Theyre making it back, slowly but surely, she said, adding that she planned to spend Friday as she did Thursday, at her sons side in the classroom.
Grief-stricken family and friends mourned the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess, while the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town.
