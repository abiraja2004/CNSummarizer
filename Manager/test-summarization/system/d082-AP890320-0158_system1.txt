Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of Peoples Deputies, but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of Sciences seat.
The 67-year-old nuclear physicist and human rights activist, who won the Nobel in 1975, said in a speech to the academy that many scientists objected to the slate for Sundays election approved by the leadership in January.
Those in the academy who support Sakharov hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority, said Andrei Mironov, a former political prisoner.
