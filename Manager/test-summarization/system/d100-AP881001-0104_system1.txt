People who write books like this, it is for greed, and as far as Im concerned, theyre gravediggers, no more, no less, Mrs. Lennon says on the CBS show 60 Minutes scheduled for broadcast Sunday evening.
Ive always loved John because he was my first love.
He spent so much time with me not just at home, but everywhere, you know.
