The Wandlitz homes, including the one in which Honecker still lives, are being converted to a medical rehabilitation center for children.
In recent weeks, East German groups have called for punishing Honecker and for moving him to smaller quarters with an outside toilet, Bild said.
Honecker, 77, underwent gall-bladder surgery in August, and East German media reported he remains seriously ill. Sources say the ailing ex-leader may be placed in a church-operated home for the elderly, or even in a monastery, Bild reported.
Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party leader and other party officials have come under investigation for charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
