Honecker, 77, underwent gall-bladder surgery in August, and East German media reported he remains seriously ill. Sources say the ailing ex-leader may be placed in a church-operated home for the elderly, or even in a monastery, Bild reported.
The current leadership fears that in such a situation, Honecker might be attacked and become a victim of lynch justice, Bild said.
Since Honecker was ousted Oct. 18, the former Communist Party leader and other party officials have come under investigation for charges of corruption and living in luxury at the cost of the state.
Bild said it had information that Lutheran and Catholic church sources have offered Honecker _ who is threated by public rage _ protection and refuge.
