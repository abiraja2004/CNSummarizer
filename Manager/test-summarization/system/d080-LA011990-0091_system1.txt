ROGER J. GUNSON, 50 -- Co-prosecutor.
Buckey was arrested in September of that year, but was released as the investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the Manhattan Beach nursery school, among them his grandmother, dozens of uncharged suspects, and eight other South Bay nursery schools.
The jury reported it was deadlocked on 13 remaining counts, and a mistrial was declared on those allegations.
Ray Buckey and his mother, Peggy McMartin Buckey, were found not guilty Thursday of molesting children at the family-run McMartin Pre-School in Manhattan Beach, a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history.
