On his FEMA visit, Mr. Bush said that he hoped there would be less carping about the emergency offices performance this time, adding that the agency took a hit for its reaction to Hurricane Hugo.
Mr. Bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the Exxon Valdez oil tanker split open in Alaskan waters and Hurricane Hugo struck the Carolina coast, and they clearly dont want a repeat of those charges now.
The White House already is talking of Mr. Bush visiting the California earthquake site this weekend.
Some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims, but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a White House in action.
