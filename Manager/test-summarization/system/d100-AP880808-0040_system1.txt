The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965, Goldman writes, when some fool described him in print as the fat Beatle.
The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection.
According to the book, Lennon also took heroin and consumed a great deal of LSD.
John Lennon spent much of a three-year span tucked away in his room, sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke, according to a biography of the slain Beatle.
The 719-page biography also details Yoko Onos $5,000-a-week heroin habit in 1979.
