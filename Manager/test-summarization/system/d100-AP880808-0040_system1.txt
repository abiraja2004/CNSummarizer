The author says the idolized Beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic, starving himself to what he perceived as perfection.
An excerpt from the book, The Lives of John Lennon by journalist and biographer Albert Goldman, appearing in the Aug. 15 issue of People magazine, discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both Lennon and his second wife, Yoko Ono.
The onset of the eating disorder can be traced to 1965, Goldman writes, when some fool described him in print as the fat Beatle.
Lennon rarely wore clothing, other than a pair of backless slippers, and avoided touching anyone, according to the book.
