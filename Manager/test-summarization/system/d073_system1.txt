; Foreign Secretary Raul Manglapus also said the eruption should have no effect on talks on the future of Clark and Subic, where leases expire Sept. 16.
; Areas around the 4,452-foot volcano covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain, police said.
; The initial explosions on Mount Pinatubo at 8:51 a.m. Wednesday sent a 10-mile-high mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies over Clark Air Base, forcing the Air Force to evacuate hundreds of American volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive communications equipment.
But it quickly weakened to a tropical storm with 60 mph winds by the time it was centered about 70 miles east of the volcano.
; Still, heavy rains churned up by the typhoon drenched Manila and the provinces near the volcano, raising fears of mudflows that could bury whole towns up to 25 miles away.
; Most of the 16,000 Americans who live and work at Clark were evacuated Monday, when scientists said it was clear that the volcano, dormant for more than six centuries, was returning to life.
; The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches.
