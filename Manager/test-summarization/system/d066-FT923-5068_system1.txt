Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars 4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it.
Sam Walton was a salesman to the core, and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called Moon Pies.
Walton makes no excuses: I realise this may sound boring to most you, he writes at one stage, but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate .
But the reader cant help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the truth.
