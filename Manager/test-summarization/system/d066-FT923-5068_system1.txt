But it is David Glass, Wal-Marts current chief executive, who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial Walton spirit best.
The real truth, one suspects, comes right at the end of the book - when Walton admits that if I hadnt gotten sick, I doubt I would have written this book.
Walton makes no excuses: I realise this may sound boring to most you, he writes at one stage, but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a Bedmate .
Given the pleadings of publishers - Doubleday paid about Dollars 4m for the manuscript - and a rather natural desire to have a final say, he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it.
