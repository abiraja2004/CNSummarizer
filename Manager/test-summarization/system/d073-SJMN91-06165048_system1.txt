; Most of the 16,000 Americans who live and work at Clark were evacuated Monday, when scientists said it was clear that the volcano, dormant for more than six centuries, was returning to life.
; U.S. officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at Clark, but they denied news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on the base were hit by molten rock.
; But officials issued no general evacuation order for Angeles, even though the city is next to Clark Air Base.
U.S. geologists advising the Philippine government said most of Angeles was not at risk, apparently basing their assessment on earth samples indicating that earlier eruptions had reached the area on which Clark now stands but had spared what is now Angeles.
