The Red Cross sent 290 units of blood from Los Angeles; the San Diego Blood Bank rushed 50 units to San Francisco within an hour of the quake; more than 400 units were sent from Portland, Ore. Giving makes them feel good, said Trudy Sullivan, a Red Cross spokeswoman in Portland.
Los Angeles, long San Franciscos West Coast competitor but equally at the mercy of the San Andreas Fault, quickly shipped doctors, sonic equipment and fire investigators to the Bay Area.
All Salvation Army centers in the Bay Area, including 34 community service centers and scores of other units, have been turned over to the relief effort.
