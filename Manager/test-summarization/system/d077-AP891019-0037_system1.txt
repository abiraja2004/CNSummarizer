We all know the horrors of an earthquake and we express our deep-felt sympathy for the people of the San Francisco Bay area.
When a major earthquake and a major hurricane hit back-to-back, you can bet it will stretch Red Cross disaster resources and manpower, said Bob Vessey, director of disaster services in Washington, D.C.
Private groups and officials from Tokyo to London to Charleston, S.C., offered help to the ruptured San Francisco Bay area, but some said relief for the earthquake could drain coffers already strained by previous disasters.
An Anheuser-Busch Inc. brewery in Fairfield, 35 miles northeast of San Francisco, interrupted normal operations to fill cans with drinking water instead of beer for free shipment to relief agencies, the company said.
