It believes this threshold may be breached in respect of Hurricane Andrew claims.
GENERAL ACCIDENT, the leading British insurer, said yesterday that insurance claims arising from Hurricane Andrew could cost it as much as Dollars 40m.
What this means is that GA is able to pass on its losses to external reinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached.
Their guess is that losses to be faced by all insurers may total more than Dollars 8bn.
Lord Airlie, the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders meeting, said: On the basis of emerging information, General Accident advise that the losses to their US operations arising from Hurricane Andrew, which struck Florida and Louisiana, might in total reach the level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed.
