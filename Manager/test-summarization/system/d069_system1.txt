Neues Deutschland, in proposing a new party platform, said socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our country and acknowledged that the popular revolutionary movement of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old system.

Kohl and Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher also disclosed that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the World War II Allies to be ready before the end of the year for presentation to a pan-European summit meeting.
West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl declared on his return from Moscow on Sunday that the way is now free for German reunification.
