Marco, a feisty boxer owned by Dov Amir, padded off with the champions trophy after beating out 800 other pretty pooches in Israels dog-of-the-year contest held in Tel Avivs Exhibition Center.
Taking a break from the headaches of the Palestinian uprising and Israels election campaign, thousands of Israelis turned out Saturday for a canine beauty pageant.
