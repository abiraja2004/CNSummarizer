We can find time for other things besides the intefadeh, said organizer Avi Marshak, using the Arabic word for uprising to describe the 9-month-old wave of Palestinian violence aimed at ending Israels occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
Marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the World Kennel Club based in Brussels, Belgium, and had judges from the Netherlands, South Africa, Italy and Britain.
Even so, we dont feel the intefadeh here, said Rafi Shahaf, a veterinarian, who was interviewed in the show ring where Conan, his steel gray Mastino Napoletano, had just taken a blue ribbon.
But although the competition was billed as an international event, organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from abroad.
