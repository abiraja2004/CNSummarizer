Every year, more and more Olympic people are out there wanting to do commercials -- basically, everybody is available, says Daisy Sinclair, a vice president with ad agency Ogilvy Group Inc. As a result, while once an aura surrounded an Olympian, now the bloom is off.
On the surface, the Games seemed to offer all the drama that usually makes for lucrative endorsement contracts.
I suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the Olympics, says Jerry Della Femina, chairman of ad agency Della Femina McNamee WCRS.
During most of the past Games, there was enough continuous TV coverage so that, much like a soap opera, it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition, says Leigh Steinberg, attorney for ice-skater Brian Boitano, a gold medalist at the 1988 Winter Games.
