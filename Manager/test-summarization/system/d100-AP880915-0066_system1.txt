Its a very dramatically described something, but its not about John, Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.
She denied that Lennon was homosexual; that he was using drugs while living at the Dakota with his son, Sean; that he had become a reclusive rock n roll Howard Hughes.
Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartneys 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.
The whole thing is just sickening, said Julian, who also refuted Goldmans tales of Lennon as a violent father.
