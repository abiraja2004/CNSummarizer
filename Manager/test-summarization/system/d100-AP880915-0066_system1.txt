Its a very dramatically described something, but its not about John, Ono said Wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by Albert Goldman.
Goldman also charges she was responsible for Paul McCartneys 1980 marijuana bust in Japan, had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as Lennon.
As for Ono, Goldman shows her as a gold-digger who snorted heroin up to the time of Lennons death.
The book has already drawn angry responses from friends of Lennon and Ono McCartney, who contradicted one anecdote involving Lennon smashing a painting in Pauls home, has urged a boycott of the book.
