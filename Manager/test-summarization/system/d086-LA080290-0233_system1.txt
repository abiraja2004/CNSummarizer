Kuwaits U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the countrys oil facilities.
The assault followed two weeks of tension between Kuwait and Iraq, caused by Iraqi accusations that Kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area.
Baghdad television said Iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks, depending on how quickly the situation stabilized.
The invaders surrounded the palace of Kuwaits ruler, Sheik Jabbar al Ahmed al Sabah.
For its part, the provisional government announced through Baghdads official Iraqi News Agency that it was dissolving Parliament and would hold free and honest elections at a future date.
