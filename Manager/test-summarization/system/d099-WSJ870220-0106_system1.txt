The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics has created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed as an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it -- as well as for the city.
While some runners will be paid to appear, this years field, like last years, lacks some of the superstars who race in Boston, New York and London.
Mr. Lebow, organizer of the New York event, says next years Los Angeles Marathon will surpass that number.
A $50,000 fee enables the company to use the marathons name in its ads; Ellesse will spend an additional $100,000 dressing race personnel in T-shirts and warm-up suits, showing its clothes at the marathons public Expo of sponsors wares, and posting a dozen big street banners along the course.
