The New York Road Runners Club, organizer of the race, stopped promoting the event some years ago because it had all the runners it wanted.
We wont spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners, he says.
The race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by Los Angeless role as host of the 1984 Olympics.
The exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum $60,000 fee or 4% of gross cash receipts to the city.
The city that invented the corporate-sponsored Olympics has created a marathon unlike others -- artfully dressed as an Olympic-type amateur race, but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it -- as well as for the city.
