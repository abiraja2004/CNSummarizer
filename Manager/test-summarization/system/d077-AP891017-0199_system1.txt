The thing struck just as everyone was going home, said Tom Mullins, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento.
Televised footage of the bridge connecting Oakland and San Francisco showed that a 30-foot section of the upper deck had collapsed, leaving two cars dangling between the two levels.
One major fire was blazing in San Franciscos Marina District and another near the library at University of California at Berkeley.
It occurred at 5:04 p.m. PDT and was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico on the Pacific Coast.
There were unconfirmed reports that a shopping mall collapsed in San Jose, 50 miles south of San Francisco.
