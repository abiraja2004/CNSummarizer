The thing struck just as everyone was going home, said Tom Mullins, a spokesman for the California Office of Emergency Services in Sacramento.
It occurred at 5:04 p.m. PDT and was centered in the Santa Cruz, Calif., area, 75 miles south of San Francico on the Pacific Coast.
San Francisco Police Officer Dwayne Collins said there were reports that buildings and statues in the historic South of Market district near downtown had collapsed.
Then I saw falling glass, broken glass on the street, but luckily not near me,  said Les Galvacs who was walking down Market Street in downtown San Francisco.
