John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 years Liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatles came from Liverpool, said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after the unveiling.
Dozens of fans of rock legend and former Beatle John Lennon gathered in the snow on a windy Saturday for a ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of his death.
Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, including Father Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The Beatles l966 hit song Eleanor Rigby.
The center was built on the original site of the Cavern Club, made famous when The Beatles played there in the 1960s, and has become a place of pilgrimage.
