John was always a son of Liverpool and over the last 10 years Liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the Beatles came from Liverpool, said Lennon biographer Ray Coleman after the unveiling.
On Friday, a small group of invited guests had gathered at Liverpools Beatles Museum to watch Mrs. Gavin unveil a plaque marking the 10th anniversary of Lennons death.
Many friends and followers of Lennon were present, including Father Tom McKenzie, immortalized as Father MacKenzie in The Beatles l966 hit song Eleanor Rigby.
A spokesman for the Lennon family said Ms. Ono and the couples son, Sean, were in Europe and would spend the anniversary privately.
