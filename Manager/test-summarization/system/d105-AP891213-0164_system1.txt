The government has decided to give ethnic Germans and Crimean Tatars who were expelled from their homelands by Josef Stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years, Tass reported Wednesday.
The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas.
Several thousand Tatars have been filtering back to the Crimea each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return.
The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated.
