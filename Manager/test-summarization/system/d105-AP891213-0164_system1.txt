The Tatars of the Crimea and the ethnic Germans who lived on the Volga River were forcibly resettled during World War II, when Josef Stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas.
The explosive conflict between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over the Nagorno-Karabakh region has led to 200 deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last two years.
The Nov. 28 plan approved by the Supreme Soviet recommended excluding from the German region areas where resistance to German resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts.
The Tatars and Germans, among others, long have been agitating to return from Siberia and Central Asia to their traditional lands, and last month the Supreme Soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under Stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated.
