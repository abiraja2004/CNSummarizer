Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also has a replica of Sam Waltons original office at the store, including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.
Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his dance on Wall Street, which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
Walton and his brother, Bud, opened the first Wal-Mart Discount City in 1962.
Inside, an electronic map details the companys 1,500-plus store chain today.
And Wal-Mart Vice Chairman Donald Soderquist recalls that when Walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to Ben Franklin headquarters in Chicago, officials there just really didnt see a future in it.
