Typical of the Wal-Mart outlook, Dust Bowl Oklahoma is termed a place to grow and to dream in a video on the Walton family.
The window displays date back to the stores opening, with Simplicity patterns and Johnsons Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow.
Aside from the other displays and presentations, the center also has a replica of Sam Waltons original office at the store, including many fixtures he used 40 years ago.
Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his dance on Wall Street, which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
