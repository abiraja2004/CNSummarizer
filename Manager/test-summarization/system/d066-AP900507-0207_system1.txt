The window displays date back to the stores opening, with Simplicity patterns and Johnsons Glo-Coat, a box of Dreft and some Ivory Snow.
Don Shinkle, Wal-Marts director of corporate and public affairs, attributed Wal-Marts success to its associates _ the term for employees first coined in 1972 to stress that all Wal-Mart employees are partners in the company _ and to Sam Waltons leadership and knack for hiring the right person at the right time.
Also on display at the center is the hula skirt that Sam Walton donned for his dance on Wall Street, which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record 8 percent pre-tax profit in 1984.
