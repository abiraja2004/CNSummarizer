The prize to the author is a check for 20,000 pounds (nearly $38,000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business.
The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
The Booker Prize is Britains literary event of the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in Londons ancient Guildhall.
British publishers are very secretive about their sales but we know that when Thomas Keneally won it in 1982 for Schindlers Ark, his publishers, who had printed 15,000 copies, sold 75,000 over the next 23 weeks, said Christine Shaw of Book Trust.
