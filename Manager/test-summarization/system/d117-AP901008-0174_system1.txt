The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
The trust is a charity promoting reading and books and administers the prize.
The prize to the author is a check for 20,000 pounds (nearly $38,000), sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business.
As public debate rages over whos in, whos out and who might win, with bookmakers across the country calling the odds, the jurors meet again and finally select the winner on the afternoon of announcement day.
The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is spectacular, said Shaw.
