The prize has become internationally known, and the worldwide demand for the winning book, in English and translations, is spectacular, said Shaw.
The prize was first awarded in 1969 after talks between Booker and the Publishers Association on the need for a significant literary award to encourage and reward good writing.
The Booker Prize is Britains literary event of the year, guaranteed to boost sales of the chosen novel after the award announcement Oct. 16, and dinner in Londons ancient Guildhall.
