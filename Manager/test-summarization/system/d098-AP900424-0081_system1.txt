Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the liftoff was a double whammy because it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the HST.
Jubilant astronomers saw decades of work take wing Tuesday as the Hubble Space Telescope was boosted high above Earth to launch a great adventure for mankind.
Charles Robert ODell, a Rice University space physicist who has worked 19 years on Hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was comparable to raising a child.
Two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the Kennedy Space Center, the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff.
