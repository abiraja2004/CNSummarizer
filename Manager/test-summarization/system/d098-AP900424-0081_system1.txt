Charles Robert ODell, a Rice University space physicist who has worked 19 years on Hubble, said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was comparable to raising a child.
Discoverys liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended seven years of delays.
There were times when we were elated about Hubbles progress, said William H. Jeffreys, a University of Texas astronomer and Hubbles astrometry project leader.
Ive been with the program since it was a concept.
The power of the launch was awesome and the telescope has an awesome power, Norman said.
Ed Weiler, NASA program scientist for Hubble, said watching the liftoff was a double whammy because it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the HST.
