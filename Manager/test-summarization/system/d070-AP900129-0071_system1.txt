One of Honeckers doctors, Horst Vogler, said the former leader was very depressed and his mental state impaired following two major surgical operations since August.
On Sunday, West Germanys mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition.
Honeckers lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, asked the chief prosecutor to free the former leader from Rummelburg prison based on a doctors statement that he is too ill to stay in jail, ADN said.
West German television showed an impassive Honecker being led out of the hospital by his wife, Margot, in pre-dawn darkness.
