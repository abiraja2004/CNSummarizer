Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East Germany for 18 years, had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
One of Honeckers doctors, Horst Vogler, said the former leader was very depressed and his mental state impaired following two major surgical operations since August.
ADN said the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. Peter Althaus, repeated today that in his opinion Honecker is still not well enough to be jailed.
Honeckers lawyer, Wolfgang Vogel, asked the chief prosecutor to free the former leader from Rummelburg prison based on a doctors statement that he is too ill to stay in jail, ADN said.
