Police, however, said there was as yet no evidence that race played a role.
Patrick Edward Purdy, who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school playground Tuesday, killing five children and wounding 29 more, had been a student at the school from kindergarten through third grade, officials said today.
Police investigators last night searched the Lodi motel room where Purdy had been staying.
