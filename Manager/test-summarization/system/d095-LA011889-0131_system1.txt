Police officials said they still had not determined what set off Purdy, a troubled drifter in his mid-20s with a history of relatively minor brushes with the law.
Each child was given a stuffed animal at the principals office.
Investigators had not yet determined if any teachers at Cleveland Elementary were there when Purdy was in attendance from 1969 to 1973.
Someone also had placed there a pink teddy bear with angels wings.
Other relatives described Purdy as a child alcoholic and a loner who had bounced across America, looking for work as a welder.
Cleveland Elementary was in session today, although only a little more than 200 pupils -- roughly one-fourth of the student body -- showed up for classes.
