The novel, a story of Scottish low-life narrated largely in Glaswegian dialect, is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers, who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring, elitist and - worst of all - unsaleable.
After hours of heated delib-eration - under a system described as mad by one judge - the Pounds 20,000 Booker Prize for fiction last night went to Mr James Kelman for How Late It Was, How Late, published by Secker and Warburg.
Most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers, who dismissed the shortlist as narcoleptic.
One guest at the prize-giving dinner at Londons Guildhall, Mr Salman Rushdie, who won the prize in 1981 with Midnights Children, remarked: James Kelman is good, but not as good as he thinks he is.
