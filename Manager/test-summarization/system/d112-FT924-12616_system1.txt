There is no evidence to suggest that Maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments, said Mr Malcolm Pein, international chess master and director of Chess and Bridge, which yesterday took over the business and assets of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge.
Mr Pein said the new company wanted to use and pay for the premises of Maxwell Macmillan Chess and Bridge - prefabricated buildings in the village of Wheatley, Oxfordshire - until they found permanent premises.
And when Pergamon was sold to Elsevier last year Maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses.
Even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from Price Waterhouse, administrator to the public Maxwell companies they then ran into trouble with Arthur Andersen, administrator to the private Maxwell businesses.
