The latest casualties are directors James L. Brooks, whose movie Broadcast News was nominated though he wasnt, and Spielberg who was left out in the cold with his Empire of the Sun.
Since no movie has ever won a best picture Oscar without its director at least being nominated, the chances of the once-favored Broadcast News to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on April 11 have been significantly reduced.
Two years ago, The Color Purple received 11 nominations but not for him as director.
1 on polls of the greatest American films, was nominated in 1941 for best picture (there were 10 nominees in those days), for Orson Welles performance, direction and co-scripting with Herman Mankiewicz, Gregg Tolands camera work, plus art direction, sound, music and editing.
