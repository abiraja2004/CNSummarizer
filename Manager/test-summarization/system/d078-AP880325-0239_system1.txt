Some observers cite the fact that only 257 directors nominate for the Academy Awards, and many are veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are the biggest moneymakers in history (Jaws, E.T., Raiders of the Lost Ark).
Two years ago, The Color Purple received 11 nominations but not for him as director.
The Directors Guild nevertheless named him best director that year.
Charlie Chaplin received one at the first Academy Awards for his creation of The Circus and again at the 44th awards for the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century.
