You cant swim out there that long in the Ohio River, said Chuck Vogt, Belmont County coroners investigator.
The death toll from last weeks flash floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River, and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still listed as missing.
The number of names on the list of missing dropped from 18 to 14 with the identities of three victims and a call by one person alerting authorities that she was safe, Vogt said.
