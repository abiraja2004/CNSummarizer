The main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire 16-inch-diameter shells from its 62-foot-long barrel.
The extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the burst, but some red-hot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel.
The 20-mile range of the 16-inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be fired at much greater distances.
The 16-inch guns on the USS Iowa, which can lob a shell the weight of a Volkswagen 23 miles, have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age, critics say.
