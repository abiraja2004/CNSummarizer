The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations not to take punishing measures against it or Iraq.
The vote followed similar sanctions imposed on Iraq by much of the West, including the United States, Japan and the European Community.
The United Nations has no enforcement mechanism but later could call on members to take military action against Iraq or impose a blockade.
