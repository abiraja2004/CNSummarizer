The Soviet Union and China said they would halt arms shipments to Iraq.
In a statement carried by the Iraqi News Agency on Sunday, the Iraqi-installed military government of Kuwait warned other nations not to take punishing measures against it or Iraq.
The last time was 1967 when the Security Council voted similar, comprehensive sanctions against the white minority government of Rhodesia.
The sanctions were intended to force Iraq to withdraw its troops from Kuwait and the resolution bans the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in Iraq or Kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution.
