Ten doctors gave emergency treatment at the scene and 11 ambulances took the injured to two hospitals, the ambulance service said.
They are suffering from flash burns to their head and arms, fractures, and the sort of injuries you would expect after an explosion, said a spokesman for Buckland Hospital in Dover, 20 miles south of Deal.
Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons.
About 60 soldiers narrowly escaped death or injury in February when they were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded.
