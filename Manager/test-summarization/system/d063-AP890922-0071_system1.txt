Three people died later and a total of 51 were injured in the bombings.
An explosion rocked the Royal Marines School of Music in a southeastern coastal town today, causing one building to collapse and killing eight people, officials said.
Firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search for those trapped in the debris, said Kent Fire Brigade spokesman Kevin Simmons.
They are suffering from flash burns to their head and arms, fractures, and the sort of injuries you would expect after an explosion, said a spokesman for Buckland Hospital in Dover, 20 miles south of Deal.
The blast occurred at at 8:26 a.m. in a lounge in the barracks near Deal, about 70 miles southeast of London, the Defense Ministry said.
