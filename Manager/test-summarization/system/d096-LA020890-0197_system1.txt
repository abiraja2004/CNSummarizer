One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds, with the two other facilities sharing 25%.
Under a joint agreement, the Coliseum and Anaheim Stadium did not submit competing bids, but they would share in the revenues if Pasadena gets the game, said Ed Aghjayan, Pasadenas deputy city manager.
But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the citys Board of Directors.
Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL.
