The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items.
One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds, with the two other facilities sharing 25%.
But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the citys Board of Directors.
Under the proposal for the 1993 game, the city would give up most of the previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the NFL.
