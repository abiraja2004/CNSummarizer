The Sports Council, which represents the Los Angeles-Orange County area in trying to bring major sports attractions here, also will offer the NFL all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items.
But as bidding for the Super Bowl has become more competitive, the NFL has taken more of the income, Aghjayan said in a report to the citys Board of Directors.
One plan calls for the Rose Bowl to receive 75% of the proceeds, with the two other facilities sharing 25%.
In most parts of the country, the stadium is offered rent-free in exchange for the benefits to local economies, he said.
