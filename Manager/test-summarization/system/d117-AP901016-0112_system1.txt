The panel was unanimous, however, in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult.
Critic and novelist A.S. Byatt on Tuesday won the Booker Prize, Britains most prestigious literary award, for her tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary Victorian poets.
Television executive Sir Denis Forman, chairman of the judges panel, announced the prize at a banquet in Londons Elizabethan Guildhall, seat of the citys Lord Mayor.
There was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally Possession by A.S. Byatt was the winner by a majority vote, said the judges.
