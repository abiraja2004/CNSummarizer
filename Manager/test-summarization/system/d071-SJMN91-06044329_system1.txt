; McFadden said he handles an average of 20 to 25 dogs at each show and works around 120 shows a year all over the U.S.
; We make a good living but the overhead is high and the hours long.
Before a show we sometimes work around the clock brushing and cleaning the dogs, working on their coats, said McFadden.
The aim, he said, is to have a confident and happy dog entering a competition.
; Over the last seven years, McFadden and his wife have shown dogs representing approximately 75 percent of the 135 breeds of dog.
The couple also owns two standard poodles and breed wire fox terriers.
