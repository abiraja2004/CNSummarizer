At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa of the Home Affairs Ministry.
Adhikari said local officials had not yet heard from the government on compensation or new housing for people whose homes were demolished.
Indian officials said 200 people were injured in the quake.
At least 131 bodies were found in the city of 100,000.
Aftershocks have persisted since Sundays quake, and rumors of an impending new quake sent thousands of people fleeing into the streets in panic before dawn Tuesday in Katmandu and Dharan.
Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.
