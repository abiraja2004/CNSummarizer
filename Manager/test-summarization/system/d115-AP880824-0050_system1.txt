At least 549 people were killed in Nepal, said Tek Bahadur Thapa of the Home Affairs Ministry.
Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.
Most of the homeless have moved in with neighbors or found shelter in tents erected on the soggy earth.
Others had cracks three feet deep or were blocked by boulders the size of houses.
At least 131 bodies were found in the city of 100,000.
Indian officials have maintained since Monday that the death toll in their country was 200 or less, but the figure was questioned by opposition politicians, survivors and the local media, including the Times of India, a newspaper that generally supports the government.
