About half of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year dont have the known risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, obesity and high blood pressure.
The blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk, said John H. Laragh of the Cardiovascular Center at Cornell University and New York Hospital.
The new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by Dr. Laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack.
