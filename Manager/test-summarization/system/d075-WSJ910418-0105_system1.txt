Regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups, those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks.
The experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test, which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin, might suggest a new risk factor for heart attacks.
About half of the 1.5 million Americans who suffer a heart attack each year dont have the known risk factors for heart disease, such as high cholesterol levels, cigarette smoking, obesity and high blood pressure.
A big-selling class of high blood pressure drugs, including Bristol-Myers Squibb Corp.s Capoten and Merck & Co.s Vasotec, are known as ACE inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin.
