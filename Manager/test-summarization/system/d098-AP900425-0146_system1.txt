It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whose discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.
Discoverys astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the Hubble Space Telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a 15-year quest for secrets of the universe.
Earlier this morning, Discovery commander Loren J. Shriver maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position, with its nose pointed toward the sun.
The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earths distorting atmosphere.
