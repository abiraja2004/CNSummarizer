The Hubble telescope, delayed by technical problems and the 1986 Challenger accident, has waited seven years to take its place in space.
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescopes instruments.
The starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel.
Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built.
It is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe, and it may solve the mysteries of quasars, pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life.
