When it is in orbit, it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays.
That was to put the telescopes solar arrays, once unfurled, at the proper angle to quickly start collecting energy and protect the telescopes fixed star trackers while the instrument was being held above the payload bay.
We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed, the telescope control center in Maryland said.
Controllers monitoring the telescope at Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland said Tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard Hubble, the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built.
