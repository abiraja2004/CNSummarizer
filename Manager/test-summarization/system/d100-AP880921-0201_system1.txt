Those attacks dont really bother him, unless they come from someone who hasnt read The Lives of John Lennon, Goldman said.
Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney, Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame because hes no longer around to answer the allegations.
When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into The Lives of John Lennon, his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.
That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters, family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson.
