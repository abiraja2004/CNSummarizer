These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest documentaries, when theyre in-house documentaries, said Goldman, who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show.
As for the sensational charges of bisexuality, drug abuse by Yoko and John, wild drinking binges, anorexia and reclusiveness, Goldman says it all fits together with the image of Lennon presented by those who knew him.
I resent people commenting on a book they havent read, including Yoko, the author said.
Goldman also rejected the complaint raised by Ono, McCartney, Julian Lennon and others that Lennon is an easy target to defame because hes no longer around to answer the allegations.
