When celebrity biographer Albert Goldman began digging into The Lives of John Lennon, his first move was to mail a long, reverential request for help to Yoko Ono.
That vision of the ex-Beatle has infuriated Lennon supporters, family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing; it also taught Goldman _ who says he is a John Lennon fan _ a hard lesson.
Those attacks dont really bother him, unless they come from someone who hasnt read The Lives of John Lennon, Goldman said.
These giant promotions of Yoko are presented as honest documentaries, when theyre in-house documentaries, said Goldman, who complimented Ono on a well-prepared show.
