At 11 a.m., a business call arrived from New York, and the crew discovered that Maxwell was not aboard.
; His mysterious death came as Maxwell was embroiled in an international controversy, something common in a life that had the improbable, extravagant and sometimes mysterious character of British fiction.
He was last seen alive on the deck of his yacht at 4:45 a.m. EST, Daily News spokesman John Campi said.
; Maxwell had just been accused in a book by reporter Seymour Hersh of having close ties to the Israeli secret service.
; A labor union leader once said Maxwell could charm the birds out of the trees.
