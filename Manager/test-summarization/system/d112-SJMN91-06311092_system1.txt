; On the steps of Mirror Group Newspapers in London, Ian Maxwell told reporters the moment was tragic not only for his family but also for Maxwells thousands of employees.
; His body was found 20 miles northwest of Grand Canary Island after an extensive air-and-sea search, officials at the rescue center in Madrid said.
An autopsy is planned for today, and the cause of death is officially still unknown.
Maxwells death ended the reign of a contentious media baron who battled unions, barked out orders in eight languages and bullied editors as he built a $2 billion media conglomerate.
The body was taken by helicopter to the Gando air base on Grand Canary Island, where it was identified by Maxwells wife of more than 40 years, Elizabeth, and their son, Phillip.
