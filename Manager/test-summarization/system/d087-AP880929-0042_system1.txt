Griffith Joyner, who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the 100 meters, had a big lead Thursday as she turned the curve for the final 100 meters.
Griffith Joyner dashed to her second gold in 21.34 seconds, shattering the world mark she had set just 90 minutes earlier in her semifinal heat.
She also stayed on target to become the second woman to win four track and field gold medals in a single Olympics.
Noted for her long, painted fingernails and racy, colorful bodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the 1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S. sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948.
