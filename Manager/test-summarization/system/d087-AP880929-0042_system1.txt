Griffith Joyner, who set an Olympic record Sunday in winning the 100 meters, had a big lead Thursday as she turned the curve for the final 100 meters.

Noted for her long, painted fingernails and racy, colorful bodysuits, Griffith Joyner of Los Angeles has a chance to match the 1984 quadruple gold medal performance of U.S. sprinter and long jumper Carl Lewis, and by Fanny Blankers-Koen of the Netherlands in 1948.
