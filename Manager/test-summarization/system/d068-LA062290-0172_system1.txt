Checkpoint Charlie went up in 1961 in the middle of the Friedrichstrasse boulevard after Communist East Germany erected the Berlin Wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of West Berlin.
Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a gesture of reconciliation with the Western members of the wartime alliance: Britain, France and the United States.
The checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that Berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free, British Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd said in a speech.
The closing of this checkpoint offers further proof of a turn for the better in the international arena, for overcoming the legacy of confrontation, he said.
