Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job, Emmanuel said.
Overall, I think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where Hugo would be so officials in South Carolina could act in a timely manner, said research meteorologist Colin McAdie.
Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugos landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation.
We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products, Pyke said, and that its ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storms path.
