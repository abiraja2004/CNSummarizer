Thats not my brother, thats not my mother, thats not my childrens grandmother, said Baird, who recently spent three weeks in the United States promoting her book, a family portrait of Lennon and his Liverpool roots.
Baird wanted to do a book about the ex-Beatles maligned mother, whose name also was Julia.
Giulianos text reads like oral history, as if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the readers knees to boast about her brother, the musician.
I wanted to set the record straight about our mother, and that ties in with John.
It tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage.
