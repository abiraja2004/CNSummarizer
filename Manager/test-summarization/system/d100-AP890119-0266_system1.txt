The end of the book describes what Baird calls Lennons desire to regain his lost Liverpool roots, when she and her step-brother exchanged letters and phone calls during 1975-80.
The result is a little of both, a mishmash of anecdotes showing a moody but generally happy Liverpool boy singing with his mother in a bathroom with good acoustics.
Baird has been accused of cashing in on her step-brother but insists she just wants to tell the familys story of Lennons early years.
Giulianos text reads like oral history, as if a British schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the readers knees to boast about her brother, the musician.
