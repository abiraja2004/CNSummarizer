Dooley said no information would be released until the probe is completed, and the Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.
They said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck; if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete, the hoist would have been sealed off.
The Times cited unidentified sources as saying this indicated the explosion occurred while the bags containing 550 pounds of propellant powder were still being loaded into the gun.
Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said.
