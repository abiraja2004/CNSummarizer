Navy investigators will be looking at all possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to determine what caused the explosion that killed 47 aboard the battleship USS Iowa, officials say.
Dooley said no information would be released until the probe is completed, and the Navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion, which damaged only the inside of the turret.
2 guns breech open and undamaged, with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there.
Navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun, the newspaper said.
