Military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil servants around Srinagar in these dangerous days, as soldiers and paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by Moslem separatists in the Kashmir Valley.
We are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any popular movement, said Jagmohan, governor of Jammu-Kashmir, the only state in predominantly Hindu India with a Moslem majority.
Electricity was cut off in the city Friday, which was both the Moslem sabbath and Indias national Republic Day on Indias Republic Day, but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating because militants connected them to car batteries.
Officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to the Kashmir Valley since Jan. 20, but reports from various sources indicate 30,000-and 40,000 soldiers and paramilitary troops have been deployed.
