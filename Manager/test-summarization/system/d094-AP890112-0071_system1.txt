The British Broadcasting Corp. documentary, details of which were released Wednesday by its maker Edward Behr, said the U.S. prosecutors worked with the emperors aides to find a way to avoid putting Hirohito on trial.
Behr told The Associated Press in a telephone interview Wednesday that the documentary will be shown in the United States by PBS on March 13.
Gen. Douglas MacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces occupying Japan, wrote in his book Reminiscences that he fended off pressure from Britain and the Soviet Union to indict Hirohito, arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war.
The documentary challenges Hirohitos image as a peaceful man forced to go along with his generals plans and alleges among other things that he: _Must have known about the massacre of at least 20,000 Chinese at Nanking in 1937 because he received regular detailed reports from the China front.
