Celoron had planned to rename a street in Miss Balls honor during her visit, and still plans to rename it as Lucy Lane, said John Goodell of Celorons Historical Society.
She was always so full of life, said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
The American Heart Associations Jamestown office was deluged with calls from Miss Balls fans who wanted to make a memorial donation, officials said.
Goodell said that when the group was formed about a year ago, We sent an invitation to Lucille Ball to be a member, and she sent back a check for $500 for a life membership.
