But Im sure that feeling is shared by many people around the world, said Nelson Garifi, organizer of a homecoming for Miss Ball that was to have been held next month.
After she fell ill last week, residents signed the posters and sent them to her as a get-well greeting.
She was always so full of life, said Pauline Lopus, who went to school with Miss Ball and had kept in touch with her.
In high school, she starred in high school plays and made her first appearance before a large audience at the now-defunct Palace Theater here.
Lucille Ball was mourned Wednesday by the western New York hometown she left for Hollywood more than half a century ago.
