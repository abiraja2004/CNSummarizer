World oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as more countries joined the attempt to strangle Baghdads economy and force it to withdraw its invasion troops.
Britain said Baghdad had given no reason for detaining 366 people, most of them passengers from a British Airways flight stranded at Kuwait airport by the invasion.
The Iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of Westerners based in Kuwait or caught by the invasion.
It has been pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the 1980-88 war with Iran and settle foreign debts of up to $80 billion.
