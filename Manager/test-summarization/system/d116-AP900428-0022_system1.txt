This crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy, the institute said.
The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the worlds most powerful telescope.
The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe, McAfee said.
Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement.
