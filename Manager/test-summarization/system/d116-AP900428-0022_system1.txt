The discoveries made by Hubble on the 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe, McAfee said.
Using the Hooker Telescope, Hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the Milky Way, the institute said in a statement.
The shuttle that put the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the 1920s by astronomer Edwin Hubble: the eyepiece from what once was the worlds most powerful telescope.
Hubbles work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion, called the big bang, an estimated 15 billion years ago.
