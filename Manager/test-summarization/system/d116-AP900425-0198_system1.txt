Id like to pass on the quote of the day from the on-board astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today, Shriver said of Hawley.
At one day, seven minutes into the flight of Discovery, Hubble is now on its own internal power, Carr said.
Worries that the telescopes instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out.
The telescope originally was scheduled for launch in 1983, but technical problems and the Challenger explosion pushed it back.
Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome.
Hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickel-hydrogen batteries.
