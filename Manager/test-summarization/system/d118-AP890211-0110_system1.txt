The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons involved.
Defense Secretary-designate John Tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the Senate his work for a British firm involved no military matters, according to reports published Saturday.
The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has not bothered to talk to Towers neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower.
The newspaper also said Tower wrecked his car in two early-morning accidents within weeks of one another in 1970, and, two years earlier, he drove into a bicycle ridden by James Patrick Montoya, son of the late Sen. Joseph Montoya, D-N.M., on his way home from work.
