The New York Post reported Saturday that the FBI apparently has not bothered to talk to Towers neighbors, examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving Tower.
When firemen broke into his room to remove him, he was reportedly in no condition to free himself, the Post said.
The Legal Times said Tower told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by British Aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the Pentagon, and that he listed the various weapons involved.
Meanwhile, new questions were raised about the thoroughness of the FBIs background investigation of the embattled nominee.
