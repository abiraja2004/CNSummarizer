Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305 people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled with rush-hour traffic.
Rescuers also were hampered by darkness and plunging temperatures.
WAAY reported at least one person died when the roof of a business collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area.
Cars are piled on top of each other under piles of rubble where buildings used to be, said Danny Cooper, state emergency management director in Montgomery.
Rescuers picked through piles of rubble 10 to 14 feet deep, and Cooper said police were unable to determine the extent of the damaged area.
