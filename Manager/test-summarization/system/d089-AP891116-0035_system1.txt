Mayor Steve Hettinger said 305 people were injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while streets of this northeastern Alabama city filled with rush-hour traffic.
It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of, said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck.
Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and shopping areas, said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in the citys south section.
