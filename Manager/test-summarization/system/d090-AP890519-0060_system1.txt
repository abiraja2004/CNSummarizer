In a statement broadcast today by the pro-Marcos radio station DZEC, Imelda said she was trying to contact the presidential office to make a last appeal to Madam Corazon Aquino to open her heart and let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.
I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos, Mrs. Aquino said.
Ileto, who met with Mrs. Aquino for a half-hour today, said Marcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followers can cause disruptions of normal functions.
