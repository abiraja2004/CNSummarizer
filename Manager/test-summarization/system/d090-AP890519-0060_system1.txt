Ileto, who met with Mrs. Aquino for a half-hour today, said Marcos no longer posed a threat to the nation but his followers can cause disruptions of normal functions.
In a statement broadcast today by the pro-Marcos radio station DZEC, Imelda said she was trying to contact the presidential office to make a last appeal to Madam Corazon Aquino to open her heart and let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.
In Honolulu, Marcos aide Arturo Aruiza said Imelda had left the hospital to make a final appeal to Mrs. Aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland.
