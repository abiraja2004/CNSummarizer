On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern port of Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the first and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.
Workers at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw staged a protest rally Monday to demand improved safety conditions and the return of Solidarity activists to work.
Solidarity spokeswoman Katarzyna Ketrzynska said workers on the overnight shift at the Manifest Lipcowy mine stayed outside the mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift.
She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon shift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to join the striking miners.
