On Aug. 16, 1980, workers at factories around the northern port of Gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form Solidarity, the first and only independent trade federation in the Soviet bloc.
Workers at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw staged a protest rally Monday to demand improved safety conditions and the return of Solidarity activists to work.
She said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon shift, which starts at 2 p.m., from entering the grounds to join the striking miners.
The strike in Jastrzebie, about 275 miles southwest of Warsaw, comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed trade federation.
