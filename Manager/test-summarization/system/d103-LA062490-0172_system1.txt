Trucks carried aid into earthquake-stricken Iran on Saturday from Soviet Azerbaijan, which observed a day of mourning for victims, the official Tass news agency said.
A report by Tass from the Azerbaijan capital of Baku said an official day of mourning was declared in the mainly Muslim republic and that black ribbons hung from public buildings in the city.
West Germany said it was sending 200 tents and 3,200 blankets, to be followed by 100 tons of similar supplies.
