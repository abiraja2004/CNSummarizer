In the Yucatan state capital of Merida, the storms 160 mph winds destroyed nearly all the thatched houses in one district, uprooted trees, road signs and cut off water supplies, said Gonzalez Correa, news editor of Novedades.
The ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotel zone in the resort of Cancun and destroyed about a quarter of the homes on the nearby island of Cozumel.
A spokeswoman with the National Civil Defense System in Mexico City said at least 20,000 people had flocked to Merida from coastal areas.
Authorities were particularly concerned about the people trapped on another resort island just off Cancun, tiny Isla Mujeres.
