Hours later, thousands of residents gathered near Wanis house in an attempt to hold a funeral procession in defiance of a government curfew.
But soldiers and police prevented the procession and took Wanis body to a burial ground in a government ambulance escorted by a police jeep.
The body of a suspected police informer was found in Srinagar, and officials said militants claimed responsibility.
Men shouted: Ashfaqs blood will usher independence!
Tens of thousands of Moslems gathered later for the funeral.
A leader of the Moslem separatist movement in Kashmir tried to hurl a grenade into a police bunker Friday but was killed in a volley of police gunfire.
