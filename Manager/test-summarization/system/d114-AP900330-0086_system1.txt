At least 233 people have been killed in Kashmir since Jan. 20 when the government launched a crackdown on increasing violence by Moslem separatists.
The body of a suspected police informer was found in Srinagar, and officials said militants claimed responsibility.
They said the men were in a group 22 that opened fire on the soldiers.
A group militants fired pistols and automatic rifles in the air.
The secessionist movement has been alternately simmering and flaring since 1948, when the Hindu ruler of the old princely state of Kashmir, faced with the option of merging either with India or Islamic Pakistan, chose India.
