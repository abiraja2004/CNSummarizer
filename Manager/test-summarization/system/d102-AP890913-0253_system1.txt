Bob Hope keeps voluminous files, including the jokes he delivered and people he has performed with, and his first entry under Lucille Ball is an appearance with Hope in 1945 on a show called G.I.
I think Ill do my tribute to her over a shot of that in the background.
I could do a fashion show with her walking on stage, Hope said of the show clips he had been watching in preparing the special.
I really cant remember many details about it, said Hope, who pays tribute to his frequent co-star in an NBC special Saturday night.
That first time together was followed by four movies, frequent visits by Hope on I Love Lucy and regular appearances by Lucy on his television shows.
