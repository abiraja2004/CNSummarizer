Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugos fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldnt heed Hugos warnings.
Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings.
The storm, which caused billions in damage, claimed 17 lives in South Carolina, and only two were in the Charleston area, which bore the brunt of Hugos 135 mph winds.
