Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugos fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing.
Since then several big storms have threatened but veered away, and officials were worried that Charlestonians wouldnt heed Hugos warnings.
Weve had so many close calls, said Gary Garnet, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.
Mayor John Bourne of North Charleston, where there apparently were no storm-related deaths, credited people for heeding the warnings.
