Ballard, a senior scientist at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in Massachusetts, said structural evidence satisfied him that the Germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by British fire.
If unstopped, it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut British morale at a time when England stood virtually alone against combined German sea and air power.
Asked if the German commander couldnt have surrendered by ceasing fire, Ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the British would have recognized that the Germans were giving up.
