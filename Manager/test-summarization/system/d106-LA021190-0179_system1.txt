In Lusaka, Zambian President Kenneth D. Kaunda, whose country has been a refuge for the exiled leadership of Mandelas African National Congress, said his first reaction was to kneel down and thank God.
Britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated South Africa, but anti-apartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure on the white-led government.
Really, we must believe in the leadership of the people of South Africa to put their heads together and build on these developments, Kaunda said.
In London, Bob Hughes, chairman of the Anti-Apartheid Movement, said he was delighted at the news, which he called a tremendous victory for the people of South Africa and for the international sanctions campaign.
