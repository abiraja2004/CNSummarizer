Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama, said one administration official.
President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
Those relations steadily deteriorated after the United States indicted Noriega, once a ally particularly of the U.S. intelligence community, on drug trafficking charges in Florida.
Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
