Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama, said one administration official.
However, Mitchell said he hoped Bush would send the appointment to the Senate after Congress convenes Jan. 23 despite the nature of the recess appointment.
On Capitol Hill, Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell, D-Maine, called Hinton highly qualified for the post because of his wide-ranging experience and expertise in Central America.
