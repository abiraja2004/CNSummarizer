President Bush has named career diplomat Deane Hinton as ambassador to Panama, the White House announced Tuesday.
Bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in Panama, said one administration official.
Officials described Hinton as an experienced Latin America hand and a good person to have in place with the volatile developments in the South American country.
Hinton, currently ambassador to Costa Rica, replaces Ambassador Arthur H. Davis, who was recalled by Bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the Panamanian elections last May by Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega.
