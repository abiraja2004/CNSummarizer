After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons.
One of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is the conspiracy charge which names both defendants.
In an interview Wednesday evening, Pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first, either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts, or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts.
Superior Court Judge William Pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their days deliberation and called a hearing for Thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the 52 sealed verdicts.
