After conferring with lawyers, Pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons.
Jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge, but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier Wednesday.
On Tuesday, deliberations were halted at midday because a juror became ill. On Wednesday, the talks did not begin until 1 p.m. because another jurors child was ill. No alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that losing one of the 12 remaining jurors would force a mistrial.
