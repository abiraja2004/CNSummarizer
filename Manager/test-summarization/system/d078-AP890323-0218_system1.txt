Dan Lyle, who oversees the Oscar balloting for the accounting firm Price, Waterhouse Inc., said that there is no guarantee that Academy members have actually filled out their own ballots.
Given the tremendous impact both an Oscar nomination and an Oscar victory have on a films fortunes, its not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the Oscars.
Although youre asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures, I think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank, he said.
