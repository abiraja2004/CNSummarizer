In his opinion, only joint efforts can bring this information to the attention of world public opinion, point out the seriousness of this issue, and avoid the coming tragedy.
According to him, during the latest visit to the United States by [Latvian President] Guntis Ulmanis, sanction was obtained for the adoption of the aforementioned discriminatory law.
