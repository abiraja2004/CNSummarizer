; Prime Minister Atef Sidki, who traveled to Safaga, said many passengers may have been on lifeboats driven far from the wreckage by strong winds.
Investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the crew abandoned the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members pushed aside passengers to get to lifeboats.
; Survivors said that after the ferry hit the reef, crew members herded them to one side of the listing boat, then pushed passengers aside to get to lifeboats.
Today, the deputy security chief for Egypts ports said searchers have not given up.
They said the 1,105-ton ferry lay on its starboard -- or right-hand -- side, with its port side protruding from the water.
