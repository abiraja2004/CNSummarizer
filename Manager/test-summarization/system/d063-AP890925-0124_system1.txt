The young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a very long time, she said following a tour of the schools wrecked barracks in Deal, southeast England.
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher said Monday the Irish Republican Army members who blew up the Royal Marines School of Music and killed 10 bandsmen last week are monsters who will be found and punished.
We want an end to all violent deaths arising out of the present relationship between our two countries, Adams said.
After visiting some of the 11 injured bandsmen still in the hospital, Mrs. Thatcher pledged: The hunt for the bombers will be pursued with all possible speed, vigor and dedication.
