Later last year, Robert Maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with US investment banks, from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at a high price.
It also emerged yesterday that National Westminster Bank, the biggest lender to the Maxwell private companies, felt badly let down by Maxwell because he failed to deliver funds on time at the end of July.
Yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire, they did not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the Bank of England.
