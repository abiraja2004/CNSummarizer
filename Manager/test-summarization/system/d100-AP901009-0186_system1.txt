On the West Coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1 billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood near Lennons star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the Imagine broadcast: Imagine all the people, living life in peace You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one I hope some day youll join us And the world will live as one.
John Lennons worldwide message of peace was delivered Tuesday as his song Imagine was played simultaneously for 1 billion people in 130 countries to celebrate what would have been his 50th birthday.
