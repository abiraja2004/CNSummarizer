The communist world gets its first McDonalds next week, and some people here are wondering whether its American hamburgers will be as popular as the local fast-food treat, Pljeskavica.
In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica, said an official of Genex, Yugoslavias largest state-run enterprise that will operate the McDonalds.
The next East European McDonalds is scheduled to be opened in Budapest, Hungary, by the end of this year, said Vesna Milosevic, another Genex official.
The long-awaited opening of the restaurant on one of Belgrades main downtown squares will take place March 24, the Yugoslav news agency Tanjug reported, and it will offer Big Macs, fries and the other specialities familiar to McDonalds customers in the West.
