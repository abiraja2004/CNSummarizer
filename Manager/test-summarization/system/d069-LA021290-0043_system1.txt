Ever since reunification became a blazing issue, Kohls standing in West German opinion polls has risen, and if the national elections, now scheduled for December, were held today, he would have a good chance of leading his Christian Democratic Union to victory.
But if the two Germanys are fused before the West Germany election in December, the growing number of Social Democratic voters in what today is East Germany -- who would presumably be allowed to vote in December -- could easily tip the balance away from the Christian Democrats, pushing Kohl out of the government leadership.
He said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to stop the hemorrhage of East Germans to the Federal Republic and keep them in their heimat, or home, in East Germany.
