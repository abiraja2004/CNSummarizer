Kohl will meet with East German Prime Minister Hans Modrow on Tuesday and Wednesday in Bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation, including monetary union, to prevent the collapse of the faltering East German economy.
The chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in East Germany now support reunification.
Kohl said that his talks with Gorbachev -- who told him that reunification is a matter for the Germans themselves to decide -- could lead to an economic breakthrough in East Germany, which in turn could provide a push forward for all of Europe.
