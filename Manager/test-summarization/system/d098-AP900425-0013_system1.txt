Dr. Lennard Fisk, NASAs chief scientist, predicts that the Hubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era in astronomy.
For scientists, and then the rest of us, all that becomes possible now that the space shuttle Discovery has carried the Hubble Space Telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen before.
Another?
With the Hubble, says scientist Edward Weiler, such pictures are possible any time we want.
The telescope is 42.5 by 14 feet and consists of a 94.5-inch primary mirror that gathers incoming light.
Watch galaxies form.
Hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth but that the farther away they are, the faster they move.
