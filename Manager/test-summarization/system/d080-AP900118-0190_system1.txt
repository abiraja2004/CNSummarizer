If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more, Mrs. Williams said.
Even if you accept that the children were molested, said juror Mark Bassett, the evidence didnt establish that they were molested at the McMartin Pre-School.
Some said they were unsure whether Buckey was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt.
The panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic allegations, including some childrens accounts of being molested in a car wash. We just dismissed those, said Mrs. Williams.
