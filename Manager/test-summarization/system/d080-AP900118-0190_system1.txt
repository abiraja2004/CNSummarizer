If the CII tapes had not been entered into evidence and I had not seen them, I could have believed the children a little more, Mrs. Williams said.
But at CII, I could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them (by interviewers) or if they were repeating what their parents had told them.
The panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic allegations, including some childrens accounts of being molested in a car wash. We just dismissed those, said Mrs. Williams.
