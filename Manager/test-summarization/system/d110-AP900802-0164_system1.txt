The diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from Iraq in the name of the Provisional Free Kuwait Government.
That is the charge the Iraqi press leveled at Kuwait when tensions began to rise in mid-July.
The statement also said the Al-Sabah family, which had ruled Kuwait for almost 250 years, was working in concert with Zionist and colonial powers to plot against Iraq.
Britains U.N. ambassador, Crispin Tickell, called the Iraqi action an invasion from the outside ... a phony coup detat from within.
The first statement said the provisional government finds that one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the deposed, corrupt government to our brothers in Iraq.
