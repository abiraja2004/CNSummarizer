If we are to fashion a joint approach by Russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union, we must address all these concerns.
This has meant that, even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots, it has been wary of appearing to endorse Russian involvement instead, in case it had imperial tendencies.
Equally, these disputes are of legitimate concern to Britain, its western partners and the whole international community, both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability.
We need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership.
