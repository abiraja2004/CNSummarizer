By far the worst damage was in Huntsville, where an estimated 1,000 people were left homeless and National Guardsmen stood watch against looting Thursday.
Most of the dead were in apartments and stores that were torn into twisted wreckage, or in cars blown off the pavement.
Alabama Power Co. reported Thursday that violent winds had battered the switchyard of the Farley Nuclear Power Plant near Dothan on Wednesday night, causing about three gallons of concentrated PCBs to spill.
Police spokeswoman Susan Williamson said there had been minor looting the night of the storm but no arrests.
All but one of the victims, who ranged in age from 7 to 67, were killed along Airport Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that seemed to be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march.
