The Bush administration demanded immediate withdrawal of the Iraqi forces and added that it was reviewing all options in its response to the Iraqi aggression.
The White House denounced the incursion, issuing a statement that said, The United States strongly condemns the Iraqi military invasion of Kuwait ... We have conveyed this message to the Iraqi ambassador in Washington and to the Iraqi government through our embassy in Baghdad.
The invaders, whose forces far outnumber those of smaller Kuwait, were led by the elite Republican Guard that did the brunt of the fighting in the 1980-88 war with Iran.
Moments later army tanks and armored personnel carriers were moving in the direction of the Royal Palace, apparently to reinforce the guards.
