In an urgent conference late yesterday, the Guangdong provincial government urged localities to help flood victims with food, shelter, clothing and medical care so that no one would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in the flooded areas.
While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts and with support from various departments.
Floods hit Guangdong, Guangxi, Hunan, Jiangxi, Fujiang and Zhejiang provinces following the first heavy rains and floods which typically hit China from the south to the north from June to August.
