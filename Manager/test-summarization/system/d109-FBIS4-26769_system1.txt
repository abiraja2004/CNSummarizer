While inspecting flood control and relief work in Jiangxi Province, through which the Ganjiang flows, Wen Jiabao, alternate member of the Political Bureau and member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, said the flooded areas should work hard to mitigate losses through their own efforts and with support from various departments.
While inspecting Nanchang, the capital city of Jiangxi, and Fengcheng, Xingang, Jian and Taihe, on June 24-26, Wen said the key to mitigating economic losses is to resume production as soon as possible.
The province has allocated 300 million kg of grain and 110 million yuan in cash along with over 10 million tons of such farm production supplies as chemical fertilizer and diesel oil to the flood-stricken areas.
