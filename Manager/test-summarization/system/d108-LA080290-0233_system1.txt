Kuwaits army was no match for Iraq, battle-hardened after eight years of war with Iran.
Iraqs powerful army claimed victory today in its lightning invasion of this small, oil-rich kingdom.
Kuwaits U.S. ambassador said the Iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the countrys oil facilities.
The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free Kuwait.
Operating from an unknown location, al Ahmeds government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating: Kuwait is Kuwait to its people, led by the emir, Sheik Jabbar, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad.
