The Iraqi government of President Saddam Hussein claimed that it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free Kuwait.
Baghdad television said Iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks, depending on how quickly the situation stabilized.
It was the first time in modern history that an Arab nation had invaded another and taken over its government.
Operating from an unknown location, al Ahmeds government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating: Kuwait is Kuwait to its people, led by the emir, Sheik Jabbar, and his Crown Prince Sheik Saad.
