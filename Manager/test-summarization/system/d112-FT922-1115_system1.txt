Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell, two sons of the late Robert Maxwell, are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions.
He says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations, including Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, over more than Pounds 40m in transfers from MGN if the bank was aware that they were effected for improper purposes.
In his report Sir Robert points to certain weaknesses accepted by the MGN board: Internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval; Bank mandates authorised by Robert Maxwell and Mr Stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of Maxwell or directors who were also directors of Maxwell-controlled companies; The audit committee of non-executive directors, which might have reviewed systems and mandates, but was not convened; The finance departments inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury departments activities.
