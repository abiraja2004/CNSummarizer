Dwain Schenck, a relief worker for AmeriCares Foundation, said the Connecticut-based relief group expects to send 80,000 pounds of medical supplies, two doctors, a nurse and about half a dozen relief workers to Iran today.
Setting aside years of animosity, the U.S. government joined with private humanitarian groups Friday to funnel medicine, tents, clothing, food and other relief materials to help earthquake-stricken Iran.
State Department officials said the government gave $300,000 worth of supplies to the American Red Cross for shipment to Iran -- including 1,000 hard hats, 1,000 pairs of leather gloves, 10,000 face masks, 2,940 wool blankets and about 500 tents.
