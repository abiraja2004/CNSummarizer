State television said Wednesday that the strike in the Donetsk basin had spread to 70 of its 120 mines, more than triple the previous number, and that mine construction workers had joined.
The government has acknowledged that living and working conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made general pledges of improvements.
In Rostov, miners economic demands included extra pay for evening and night shifts, longer vacations and an increase in the price of coal to world market prices, the news agency reported.
Tass today said that the Kuznetsk strike had reached a turning point, with nine out of 11 mining centers back at work.
