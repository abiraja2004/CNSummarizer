But MacFarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound, noting that small children must be interviewed differently than adults.
Therapist Kee McFarlane later defended her work with hundreds of McMartin students, and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution.
