All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.
Whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the ability of bulls to maintain their momentum.
The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low.
Share prices rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance, has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday.
