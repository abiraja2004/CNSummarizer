Taking the tax concessions for granted, traders had driven up share prices in February to make a kill later.
The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low.
In this, they are more fortunate than they were in previous years, when they were under pressure to take advantage of a long-term capital gains tax exemption before the financial year ended in March.
Dealers seemed to like this, the BSE index rising by 5.6 per cent on Monday and Tuesday.
They are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after Black Friday, and the successful sale of Reliance stock on the BSE by international investors.
