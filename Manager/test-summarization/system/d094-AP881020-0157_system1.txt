Hirohito has received nearly 22{ pints of blood since his illness worsened Sept. 19, and the transfusions had put a strain on Hirohitos heart and kidneys, Maeda said without elaborating.
Hirohito, 87, discharged more blood and was given emergency transfusions, but was resting peacefully by nightfall, an imperial palace spokesman said.
Before his illness, Hirohito was taking about 1,300 calories daily, the official said.
Otherwise he is being fed intravenously, which gives him 600-700 calories a day, said the senior palace official, who refused to be identified.
Emperor Hirohitos blood pressure and pulse dropped sharply Thursday, but the vital signs later returned to normal as the ailing monarchs internal bleeding continued.
