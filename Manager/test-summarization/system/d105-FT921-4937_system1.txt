The daily Izvestia reported yesterday that the Cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenaries for the Russians (they are paid from Rbs2,000 to Rbs5,000 a week by the Trans Dnestr authorities).
The Trans Dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the Soviet Union while Nagorno-Karabakh has been a source of tension between Azeris and Armenians for centuries.
Industry was largely situated on the left bank of the Dnestr, in the sliver of the republic next to Ukraine, and largely staffed by Russians and Ukrainians.
From the beginning of the nationalist movement, it was clear that the Russian and, to a lesser extent, the Ukrainian minorities would be hostile, reacting to laws establishing Moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with Romania with strikes and demonstrations, and, finally last year, proclaiming Trans Dnestr independent under a Russian president, Mr Igor Smirnov.
