Share prices rebounded last week, taking the index to 2,361 and the uptrend, on balance, has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on Friday.
The immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of Bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help.
The argument will do nothing to restore investors faith in the stock market where, as measured by the Bombay stock exchanges 30-share index, shares have fallen 48 per cent from their peak early last year, including a 320 points fall since the governments budget was announced two weeks ago.
All this has taken place against a volatile background: the Bombay equity market, over the past six weeks or so, has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation, before the national budget on February 27, and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment.
A militant Sikh group fighting for independence for the Indian state of Punjab has claimed responsibility for the Bombay blasts, but police are unconvinced, saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with local criminals.
The relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and, until the weekend, the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a 13-month low.
