Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news agency ADN said.
ADN said that the director of Charite urology clinic, Dr. Peter Althaus, repeated on Monday that in his opinion Honecker was still not well enough to be jailed.
The news agency said the 77-year-old Honecker was arrested after being released from East Berlins Charite hospital, where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor.
Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
