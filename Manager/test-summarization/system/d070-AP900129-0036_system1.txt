Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news agency ADN said.
On Sunday, West Germanys mass-circulation Bild newspaper said Honecker would be arrested, but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition.
Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
Earlier this month, East Germanys Luthern Church had offered to put Honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital.
