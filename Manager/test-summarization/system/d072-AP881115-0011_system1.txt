Violinist Jacques Margolies, who played in the Philharmonic that Sunday, is still a member and was playing on Monday night.
At intermission, Mrs. Artur Rodzinski, whose late husband was the Philharmonic musics director in 1943 and hired Bernstein as his assistant, was introduced from a box.
Leonard Bernstein, whose 70th birthday in August was marked with a gala at Tanglewood, returned to Carnegie Hall with the New York Philharmonic 45 years after he made his triumphant conducting debut there with the orchestra.
He was the respectful and thoroughly engaged soloist in the final work on the program, Bernsteins Symphony No.
On Nov. 14, 1943, Bernstein, the Philharmonics then-assistant conductor, filled for an ailing Bruno Walter on such short notice there was no rehearsal.
