He provided a figurehead that kept the Japanese people firmly committed to peaceful means of achieving their national goals, Manglapus said.
Condolences also came from King Sultan Mahmood Iskandar of Malaysia to Hirohitos oldest son, Crown Prince Akihito, who immediately ascended the Chrysanthemum Throne.
There was no official comment from the nationalist Chinese government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between Taiwan and Japan, but the mass circulation Chinese daily United Evening News said: Asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of Japans militarists during World War II may bury their animosity with Hirohitos death.
