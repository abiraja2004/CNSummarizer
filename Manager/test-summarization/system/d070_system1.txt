I demand that the Soviet government immediately release Erich Honecker and extradite him to German justice officials, the Osnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohls Christian Democrats, as saying.
One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had worked for Mielkes Stasi and that they might interpret his threat against Honecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief.
Ousted East German leader Erich Honecker, who is expected to be indicted for high treason, was arrested Monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison, the official news agency ADN said.
ADN quoted Federal Prosecutor Guenter Seidel as saying he intended to continue his investigation against the former East German leaders, although their poor health often disrupted the proceedings.
East Germany authorities on Friday interrogated former Communist leader Erich Honecker about his role in the killings of people who tried to flee the country.
However, Seidel said that the investigation was not far enough along to determine whether charges could be filed against Honecker before East Germany merges with West Germany on Oct. 3.
Honecker, the aging hard-line Stalinist leader who ruled East Germany for 18 years until his ouster on Oct. 18, had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment.
