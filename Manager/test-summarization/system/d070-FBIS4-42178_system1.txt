Lawyer Nicolas Becker, who had represented 81-year-old Honecker before the Berlin court in 1992 and early 1993, told DPA on Sunday afternoon that Honecker had rejected an operation.
BFN Berlin -- Erich Honecker, the former GDR head of state, died at his house in Santiago, Chile on Sunday morning [29 May], according to his lawyer.
His colleague, Wolfgang Ziegler, had said earlier that the former most powerful man in the GDR had obviously died from his liver cancer.
Becker said he did not know whether Honecker has left a will or where the funeral would be held.
He also said he cannot say whether Margot Honecker, who had informed Becker of her husbands death, will be allowed to stay in Chile.
