Larry Seaquist, a former captain of the Iowa, told reporters earlier in the day, It seems from the reports that those powders exploded.
Although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel Thursday, their task was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swiveling gun housing where the explosion occurred.
Eleven men escaped from powder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of the turret.
Wednesdays explosion brought the worst loss of life for the Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was struck by a Spanish freighter.
