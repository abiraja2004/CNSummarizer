Wednesdays explosion brought the worst loss of life for the Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was struck by a Spanish freighter.
Investigators aboard the USS Iowa searched for clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of 47 sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and grief-stricken families dealt with the loss of their loved ones.
Adm. Richard D. Milligan, a former commander of the New Jersey, began the board of inquirys investigation, and Pentagon spokesman Fred Hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would be completed.
