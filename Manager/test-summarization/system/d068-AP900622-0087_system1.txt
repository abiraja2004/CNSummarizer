Shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with U.S. Secretary of State James A. Baker III and their counterparts from Britain, France and the two German states.
The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been staunchly opposed.
Previously, the Soviets had said their troops would stay in what is now East Germany for several years, but had left unclear the exact plans for pulling them out.
Shevardnadze, speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of the Western Allies Checkpoint Charlie, said he wanted the Big Four Powers troops out of greater Berlin within six months after unification.
