The Soviet Union said today that a united Germany can join NATO after a five-year transition period during which all Soviet and U.S. troops would leave the country.
The United States wants a united Germany to be a member of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Soviet Union has been staunchly opposed.
The four nations would reduce their military forces in the country during a three-year period following unification first by 50 percent, then bring them down to a level of token contingents, or completely withdraw them from Germany.
It also said that within six months of unification, all Western troops should leave West Berlin, which remains technically under military occupation by the United States, France and Britian.
