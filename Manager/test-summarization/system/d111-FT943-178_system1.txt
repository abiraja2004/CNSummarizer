But the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster.
If the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in European waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public, this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the Estonia.
The move to roll-on roll-off ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that, once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ships side, it can lead to the vessel capsizing.
