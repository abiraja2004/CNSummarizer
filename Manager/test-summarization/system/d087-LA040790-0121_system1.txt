As one of the worlds finest small-bore free-rifle shooters, he is coming close.
Someday, Milan Bakes of Czechoslovakia might find himself the toast of Pilsen, his hometown.
Bakes once held the record for standing, too, but that was four years ago.
Sekaric, 24, held a nine-point lead going into the final round.
Despite her lapse, she still won by 8.4 points over Bang, perhaps the most appropriately named competitor in this tournament featuring 46 countries.
Sekaric, a secretary at a shooting club, said she has been competing for 10 years.
Bakes, 27, set a world record in the kneeling portion of the three-position rifle competition Friday en route to a gold medal at the 1990 World Cup USA Olympic-style shooting tournament at Petersens Prado Tiro Ranges in Chino.
