Bush said that all of us are diminished and that Sakharov embodied all of what is good and decent in the human spirit.
Bush, in a message of condolence to Sakharovs widow, Yelena Bonner, said: All of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom.
Political leaders worldwide commended Sakharov as a man whose causes went beyond ideology.
He was a person who had his own ideas, his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly.
Lech Walesa, a fellow Nobel Peace Prize laureate, said Sakharovs death was a great loss for reform both in the Soviet Union and everywhere else.
