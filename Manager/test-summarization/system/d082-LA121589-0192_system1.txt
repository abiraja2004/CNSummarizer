The Soviet Congress stood for a minute of silence for their colleague, once considered a national hero for discovering the Soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled by Kremlin leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom.
World leaders from President Bush to President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today praised Andrei D. Sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his Soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout Eastern Europe.
Gorbachev, who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile, called Sakharov a man of conviction and sincerity.
His death represents a great loss, especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the Soviet Union and in all Eastern Europe.
