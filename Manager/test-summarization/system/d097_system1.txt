State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the companys record payout for a single disaster.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugos path into Charleston, S.C. All the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations satellite service.
Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugos fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985.
Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said.
Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing.
