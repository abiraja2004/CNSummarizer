Greenberg, who has now watched the federal government respond to two of Americas worst disasters, said he sees relatively few differences between how the Federal Emergency Management Agency worked in South Carolina and Northern California.
And a week after the hurricane, Charleston -- which like San Francisco has a tourism-based economy -- was still trying to cope with mountains of broken trees and shattered roofs.
We lost no major economic area like the Bay Bridge, said Greenberg, who was once San Franciscos undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to help the Santa Cruz police.
The hurricane knocked out all local television and radio stations, and local officials for almost two days depended on a Florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings.
