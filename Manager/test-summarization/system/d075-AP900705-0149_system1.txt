In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer.
Lefer said the TGF beta seems to block the action of other substances, such as tumor necrosis factor, that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack.
Jefferson Medical College, where the study was done, is part of Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.
