In a study at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia, a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered 50 percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the TGF beta.
TGF beta is normally present in heart cells, but the study published in Science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack.
Hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted, as in a heart attack, tend to lose creatine kinase, said Lefer.
Lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with TGF beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away.
