THE INVASION: Iraqs troops, led by about 350 tanks, crossed the border at dawn Thursday, and seized the Kuwaiti palace and government buildings 40 miles away.
THE FORCES: Iraq, a country of more than 17 million, has the Arab worlds most battle-trained army, and had massed more than 100,000 soldiers on the Kuwaiti border.
Kuwait and U.N. diplomats dismissed Iraqs claim that it invaded at the request of Kuwaiti revolutionaries.
The order also froze Kuwait property under U.S. jurisdiction _ a move intended to keep Iraq from seizing it.
Kuwaits U.S. ambassador said the nation had asked for American military intervention.
Early Friday, the invaders controlled Kuwait city, the capital.
