From todays viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments then taking place in society, said Krenz, an influential Politburo member even before Honeckers fall.
Krenz, who had responsibility for many internal security functions before Honeckers ouster, criticized the use of force during his testimony Wednesday.
Krenz added that he and other then-members of the Politburo failed to realize that the Roman Catholic and Lutheran churches were not working against but rather for the German Democratic Republic.
There was the notion in the former party leadership that everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by the Communist youth group was an action organized by enemy forces, Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin.
