From todays viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was no general Politburo discussion about the negative developments then taking place in society, said Krenz, an influential Politburo member even before Honeckers fall.
The excessive action of law enforcement authorities was neither politically nor morally justifiable, he told the panel, speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit.
There was the notion in the former party leadership that everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by the Communist youth group was an action organized by enemy forces, Krenz told an investigating commission in East Berlin.
Krenzs current occupation has not been publicized, following his fall as party chief on Dec. 3.
