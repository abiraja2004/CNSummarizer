The beer gridiron is going to be a busy and expensive place on television this January.
Miller has a consumer sweepstakes offering expense-paid trips to the Super Bowl.
Were starting a month earlier, weve added an extra promo spot and were going to have a lot more display materials in the stores, said Tom Sharbaugh, group brand director for Budweiser.
Miller, based in Milwaukee, wont say exactly how much it is spending on its 12-week, pre-Super Bowl campaign centered on a football game between a Tastes Great team and a Less Filling squad.
Millers campaign culminates Jan. 14, two weeks before the Super Bowl, primarily because Anheuser Busch bought all the Super Bowl television spots allocated for beer advertising.
