Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
In addition to Hubble, Discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive.
Hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since 1983, delayed by technical problems and the Challenger accident.
The $1.5 billion telescope, NASAs costliest cargo, will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we dont have, said William Lenoir, head of NASAs space flight program.
