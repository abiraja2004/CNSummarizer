Five astronauts boarded Discovery today for a second try at sending the Hubble Space Telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time.
Discovery will follow Hubble from 40 miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened, exposing the finely polished 94.5-inch mirror to starlight.
The day after launch, mission specialist Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space.
The shuttle is to end its five-day mission with a landing at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif.
Hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end.
