And so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful Mr. Goldman, hot to debunk, attacks his subject.
Criticizing The Lives of John Lennon for insufficient respect to the fallen Beatles legacy is rather off the point -- like condemning Charles Manson for his bad table manners.
There is his knowing, hipper-than-thou approach -- toward drugs, sex, music -- that gives him license to second-guess Mr. Lennons every move.
Say what you want about Albert Goldman, the author of the new biography, The Lives of John Lennon (Morrow, $22.95), but youve got to hand it to him: This guy is one ambitious sleazemonger.
