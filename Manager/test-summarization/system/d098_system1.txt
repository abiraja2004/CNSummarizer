The lens cover on the Hubble Space Telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems, and Mission Control told the Discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the $1.5 billion instrument.
But that proved unnecessary when the door was opened Friday morning, exposing the telescopes finely polished 94.5-inch eye to starlight for the first time.
The telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind, but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule.
On Wednesday, Hawley is to grapple the 12{-ton telescope with the shuttles mechanical arm, lift it out of the cargo bay, point it, and _ after a long checkout _ drop it overboard to orbit on its own.
It is named for the late astronomer Edwin P. Hubble, whose discovery during the 1920s that the universe is expanding gave rise to the Big Bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion 10 billion to 20 billion years ago.
After Wednesdays deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
If it had been needed, the rescue would have delayed the landing, scheduled for Sunday at Edwards Air Force Base, Calif., by a day.
