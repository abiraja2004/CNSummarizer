Rescue workers coped with aftershocks and heavy rain today in an effort to reach remote regions of the Himalayas to help victims of an earthquake whose official death toll neared 700.
Compared to the ones on Sunday and Monday, they have been declining, Madhav Prasad Pandy, senior seismologist at Nepals Department of Geology, said in Katmandu.
In Patna, India, thousands of people huddled in the rain in open courtyards Monday as rumors swept the city that another quake was imminent.
Sundays pre-dawn quake registered 6.5 on the Richter scale and claimed at least 497 lives in Nepal and 200 in India, government officials said.
