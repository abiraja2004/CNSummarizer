In India, the area with the greatest damage and casualties was just south of the border in Bihar, Indias poorest state.
Compared to the ones on Sunday and Monday, they have been declining, Madhav Prasad Pandy, senior seismologist at Nepals Department of Geology, said in Katmandu.
The quake was the worst in the region since a temblor in Indias eastern state of Assam killed 1,500 people in 1950, according to official accounts.
Rain continued in quake-affected areas, hampering access on muddy roads already cracked by the quake.
Niranjan Thapa of the Home Minstry reported extensive damage in 21 of Nepals 75 districts and at least four affected districts reported 50 or more deaths.
