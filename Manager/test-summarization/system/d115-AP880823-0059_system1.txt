Compared to the ones on Sunday and Monday, they have been declining, Madhav Prasad Pandy, senior seismologist at Nepals Department of Geology, said in Katmandu.
In Biratnagar, a city near the Indian border 150 miles east of the Nepalese capital Katmandu, residents poured into the streets before dawn today as men ran from houses to house, shouting that a message came from Katmandu that a new quake was expected before dawn.
Police in the city of 300,000 people said they received no such message.
In India, the area with the greatest damage and casualties was just south of the border in Bihar, Indias poorest state.
