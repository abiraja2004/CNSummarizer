The four men, all held at Pollsmoor Prison in Cape Town, were taken to nearby Victor Verster Prison on Dec. 23 and spent about six hours with Mandela, said Dullah Omar, an activist and family friend of the Mandelas.
The men were convicted along with Mandela and three others at the same trial in 1964.
Of the three co-defendants not at the Dec. 23 gathering, two have been released and one remains at the Robben Island Prison near Cape Town.
Mandela was moved to the suburban-style home on the prison grounds Dec. 7 after recovering from tuberculosis at a private clinic in Cape Town.
