Eugene Braunwald of Harvard Medical School said the next phase of a large study of clot-dissolving drugs will see what effect they have in unstable angina.
However, like other studies, this one found that aspirin signficantly cut the risk of heart attacks.
And this might have obscured any benefits from calcium blockers.
This is a condition in which people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work or stress.
We wanted to see if an effect would be observed with Verapamil, said Dr. Forgen Fischer Hansen of Copenhagen Municipal Hospital.
According to the Danish study, Verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks.
