A drug that eases the hearts workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
While calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart attacks, the researchers said these drugs still should have a role in treatment.
This means the drugs often cannot be given to cigarette smokers, who are frequent victims of heart attacks.
If it had an effect, it should be seen in the first 12 to 18 months, because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial infarction in this period, he said.
