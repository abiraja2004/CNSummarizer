One thing that became clear on Thursday, when Lewis won his seventh gold with victory in the long jump, was that while winning at the Olympics may bring other athletes excitement or relief, Lewis simply adores the experience.
When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the womens 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.
Lewis, on the other hand, seemed unsurprised when Mike Powell was unable to overhaul him in the long jump.
