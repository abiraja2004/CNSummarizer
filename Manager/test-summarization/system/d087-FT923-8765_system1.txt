Even though the long jump had not finished and even though 5,000m runners were trudging through a semi-final, Lewis began at once an extremely hammy lap-and-a-half of honour.
Noureddine Morcelli of Algeria will be hard to beat in the mens 1,500m.
When Voula Patoulidou, looking up at the giant video screen after the womens 100m hurdle final, suddenly realised, to her astonishment, that she had won a gold medal, she went delightfully and utterly potty, as did the other 25 Greeks in the stadium, including Queen Sofia of Spain.
Morcelli is one of five Africans in the final striving to increase their continents tally of just three Olympic medals (all Kenyan) in this event.
