The National Weather Service had issued a severe thunderstorm warning at 3:54 p.m., but the tornado struck with no real warning, said Brenda Page of the services office.
State Police and survivors said they believed the school was hit by a tornado, but the National Weather Service said it could not confirm that until investigators went to the scene.
