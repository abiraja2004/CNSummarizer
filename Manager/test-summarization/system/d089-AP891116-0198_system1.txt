By far the worst damage was in Huntsville, where an estimated 1,000 people were left homeless and National Guardsmen stood watch against looting Thursday.
All but one of the victims, who ranged in age from 7 to 67, were killed along Airport Boulevard, a busy thoroughfare that seemed to be a guide for the tornado on its deadly march.
The National Weather Service said the tornado path had covered between eight and 10 miles and that its wind speeds were as high as 250 mph.
The cafeteria collapse occurred at the East Coldenham Elementary School in Newburgh at about 12:30 p.m., when from 113 to 125 students in first, second and third grades were eating lunch, said Newburgh police Chief John Kulisek.
