Residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of Hurricane Hugos fury, and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect, authorities said.
Forecasters at the National Hurricane Center used computer models to track Hugos path into Charleston, S.C. All the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models, said Thomas Pyke, head of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations satellite service.
Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job, Emmanuel said.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the companys record payout for a single disaster.
A hurricane warning was in effect between Fernandina Beach, Fla., and Oregon Inlet, N.C. By late afternoon, Hugo was upgraded to a category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale of strength, the second mightiest category, which indicated it could cause extreme damage.
Meanwhile, Garnet had some good news for storm-weary Charlestonians: late Saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing.
