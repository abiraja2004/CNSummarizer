I looked up at a house on the hill, and it looked like it was on stilts on the water, Mrs. Schramm said.
Kerri had been playing at a friends house when the one-story home suddenly was washed away in the flood Thursday night.
Mrs. Hulderman said she, her husband and about seven others were in the 3Ks bar when a wall collapsed and water rushed through.
When they returned, the basement and first floor were flooded, and the surrounding area looked like a big lake.
The friend, 9-year-old Amber Colvin, was swept down Wegee Creek and into the Ohio River, but survived a seven-mile ordeal by clinging to logs.Amber was released from a hospital Saturday after treatment for minor injuries.
