The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and declared part of North Ossetia.
The Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians.
On October 26-27 Russian soldiers played a crucial role in crushing a coup attempt in the Tajik capital of Dushanbe.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.
At the same time, the North Ossetian government said it would distribute Russian army-supplied automatic weapons to civilian volunteers.
