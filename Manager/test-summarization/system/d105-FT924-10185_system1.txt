The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and declared part of North Ossetia.
A local official said the soldiers were seized on Friday in the Dzhermen settlement, located near the regional capital, Vladikavkaz, and populated mostly by Ingushis, Mr Felix Gutnov, spokesman for the North Ossetian interior ministry, said.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.
The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflicts.
