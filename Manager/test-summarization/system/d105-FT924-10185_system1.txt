The Caucasus mountains, which stretch from southern Russia to the borders of Turkey and Iran, are engulfed by several conflicts.
The Russian action mirrored recent developments in the former Soviet republic of Tajikistan, where Russian troops have also been deployed.
Ingush rebels were reported yesterday to have taken hostage 80 Russian interior ministry soldiers based in the region.
The Ingush, who declared an independent state in June, are demanding the return of lands that Russian leader Josef Stalin expropriated in 1944 and declared part of North Ossetia.
The Central Asian nation, which has yet to form its own army since the Soviet Union collapsed last December, has also distributed weapons to civilians.
