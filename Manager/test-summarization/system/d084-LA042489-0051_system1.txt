The scarred battleship Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
The Navy kept the news media about 300 yards from the families, and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen.
The explosion Wednesday flashed through the Iowas No.
Twenty minutes later, families started filing aboard the ship, exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors.
When the vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers among those on the dock, but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier.
