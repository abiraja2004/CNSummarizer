Kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with Pakistan, an Islamic country, but have recently been fighting for total independence and the status of a neutral country.
The militants were killed late Monday at Kupwara, 56 miles north of Srinagar during gunbattle with Indian guards, said the Kashmir official, who cannot be identified under standing briefing regulations.
A total of 80 Moslem militants have died in frontier incidents in the past week.
Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly cross over to Pakistan through the porous border and return by the same route after reciving arms training in Pakistan.
Hindus make up 82 percent of the population.
