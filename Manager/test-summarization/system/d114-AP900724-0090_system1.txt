Kashmiri separatists are fighting for independence of the Moslem dominated Jammu-Kashmir from the predominantly Hindu India.
The militants were killed late Monday at Kupwara, 56 miles north of Srinagar during gunbattle with Indian guards, said the Kashmir official, who cannot be identified under standing briefing regulations.
Kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with Pakistan, an Islamic country, but have recently been fighting for total independence and the status of a neutral country.
Indian officials maintain that Kashmiri militants regularly cross over to Pakistan through the porous border and return by the same route after reciving arms training in Pakistan.
The deaths brought the total number of people killed to at least 863 since Jan. 20, when the government launched a crackdown on the separatists.
