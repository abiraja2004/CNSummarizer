Krauts statement said it was not known whether Bernstein would be able to conduct next month at the Tanglewood festival or during the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra Tour in Europe later this summer.
Complete rest for an extended period is required if this remarkable man is to regain his usual high energy level, said Dr. Kevin Cahill, the conductors personal physician.
The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
Bernstein, 71, has suffered from severe influenza, pleurisy, and pneumonia since the beginning of the year, Cahill said in a statement released by Harry Kraut, Bernsteins manager.
