The Japan festival is believed to be the first festival in Asia where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra.
Conductor Leonard Bernstein has canceled several performances in Japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness and will return to the United States to recover, his manager announced today.
Bernstein, 71, has suffered from severe influenza, pleurisy, and pneumonia since the beginning of the year, Cahill said in a statement released by Harry Kraut, Bernsteins manager.
Krauts statement said it was not known whether Bernstein would be able to conduct next month at the Tanglewood festival or during the Tanglewood Music Center Orchestra Tour in Europe later this summer.
