Flanigan said the Peace Corps has been able to track down all but three of the 157 volunteers in Nepal.
They called this morning, thats the first we had heard about anything since the quake, said Arthur Giaquinta, whose 24-year-old son, Peter, lives in a village 10 miles north of the hard-hit Dharan Bazar township.
Were ecstatic, he said, adding that his sister had been living with a Nepalese family five miles from the earthquake epicenter.
The three, he said, are from Michigan, Wisconsin and the Philadelphia area; he declined to release their names.
The parents of a Peace Corps worker learned Thursday that their son, a volunteer in Nepal, was safe following an earthquake last weekend that killed at least 750 people in that country and neighboring India.
