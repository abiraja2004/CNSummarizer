Until the end of World War II, emperors were regarded as living gods.
Akihito has paid $2.99 million in inheritance taxes on his half of his fathers estate, which he divided evenly with his mother.
The empress dowager, as Hirohitos spouse, was exempt from paying inheritance taxes, Kyodo News Service reported.
It was the first time that tax authorities have disclosed the amount of an emperors taxable estate, an official in the Kojimachi Tax Office said.
The Japanese constitution, drafted by U.S. occupation forces shortly after the end of World War II in 1945, stipulates the emperor is the symbol of the state and the unity of the people.
