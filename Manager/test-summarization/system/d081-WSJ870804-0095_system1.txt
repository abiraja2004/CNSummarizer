The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation.
In addition to the general wage increase, Mr. Ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miners doing dangerous work.
But at this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable, said Mr. Ramaphosa, who added that there hadnt been any negotiations with management since a strike ballot received overwhelming support during the week of July 12.
