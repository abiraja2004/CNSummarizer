Our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies, where strike action could take place at any time, should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members demands.
The National Union of Mineworkers said an estimated 200,000 black gold and coal miners in South Africa will begin a strike Sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions, in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation.
The strike initially would cover more than half of South Africas gold mines and about one-fifth of its coal mines, said Cyril Ramaphosa, the unions general secretary.
