; The researchers, along with 10 Filipino scientists and their equipment, today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base, 12 miles from the volcano, where they should be safe from ash avalanches.
But it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base.
; Volcanologists know of no reason the volcanos activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.
; In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered with glowing ash, Lipman said.
