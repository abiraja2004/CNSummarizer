; Even if the volcano does not erupt, the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least, Lipman said.
; In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered with glowing ash, Lipman said.
; Scientists doubt its more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the Mount Unzen volcano in Japan, he said.
; Volcanologists know of no reason the volcanos activity could be linked to the volcano in Japan, which is of comparable size.
But winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern, expected to begin any day, would send ash directly toward the base.
