; The scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcanos slopes, to watch it swell as magma builds inside.
; Other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were El Chichon in Mexico in 1983 and Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia in 1985.; If it does have a massive eruption, Pinatubos primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash -- 1,000 degrees or more, flowing and billowing at up to 100 mph, engulfing and searing all in their path.
; In the worst case, a really big eruption, all of Clark Air Force Base could be covered with glowing ash, Lipman said.
