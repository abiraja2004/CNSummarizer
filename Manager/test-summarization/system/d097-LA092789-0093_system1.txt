Although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses, there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record $752.5 million in claims paid by the industry after Hurricane Frederic struck Mississippi and Alabama in 1979, Parsons said.
Additionally, Nationwide Insurance Co. said it expects claims close to $100 million, more than triple the $31 million that the company paid for damages caused by Hurricane Elena when it swept through Florida, Alabama and Mississippi in 1985.
The two dominant home and automobile insurers in the Carolinas said Tuesday that they expect to be hit with about $600 million in claims from Hurricane Hugo.
