I wanted to join the Independent and the hostage families and many other people in their appeal for contributions toward the needs of the Iranian earthquake victims, Rushdie said in a message delivered from his hiding place.
Iran, at odds with the United States since the 1979 seizure of hostages at the U.S. Embassy in Tehran, has said it would welcome relief from the American Red Cross and other U.S. humanitarian groups.
Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
Already though, some of the worried immigrants were turning their fear into action by mobilizing relief efforts for Iran.
Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
In Paris, the French government, which already has sent a 200-member civil defense team _ including rescuers, medical personnel and search dogs _ said Saturday it would send an entire mobile hospital unit if Iran wanted it.
Pope John Paul II was very saddened by the earthquake and has donated personal funds to help victims of the disaster, the Vatican said.
The United States on Friday sent $300,000 worth of relief supplies through the American Red Cross and is planning more aid, State Department officials said.
