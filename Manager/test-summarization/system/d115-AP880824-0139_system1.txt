The death toll from the Himalayan earthquake topped 750 on Wednesday as rescue workers hampered by monsoon rains, aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote areas of Nepal and found more bodies.
In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million people.
It was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since 1950, when, by official count, 1,500 people were killed in the eastern Indian state of Assam.
To make matters worse, survey teams found cracks in the embankments of the six rivers, which are swollen by monsoon rains that began in late June.
