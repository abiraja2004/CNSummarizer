In eastern India, which also was devastated by the quake, cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in Bihar state, and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the 10 million people.
Residents in Dharan, the worst-hit area of Nepal, also raced from their homes Wednesday during two aftershocks, officials in Katmandu said.
Rescue workers demolished 50 homes in Dharan on Wednesday that were severely damaged in the temblor, police inspector G. Adhikari said.
As survivors in both countries began rebuilding homes damaged or destroyed by the quake, medicine, food and financial aid began arriving from abroad.
