For the first time, the Communists acknowledged German unity as a long-term goal but said it must be imbedded in the process of overcoming Europes overall divisions.
Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude toward reunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it.
Modrow said the two Germanys could work toward confederation in phases with no time limit.
Lambsdorff said that because of East Germanys political instability it had only two choices _ unification or chaos.
Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev did not rule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time did not venture to set some time limits for that.
