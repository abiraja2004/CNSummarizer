Asked by an East German correspondent about his attitude toward reunification, Gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it.
Modrow told reporters after the meeting that Gorbachev did not rule out such a prospect in the future, and at the same time did not venture to set some time limits for that.
The Soviet Union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of German reunification, but Gorbachev has softened that position in adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in Eastern Europe.
Gorbachev, in comments to reporters after meeting French President Francois Mitterrand in Kiev in December, reiterated his view that the existence of two German states is a fact based on the outcome of World War II.
