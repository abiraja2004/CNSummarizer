Still, he and other Communist leaders have warned that if the strikes dont end quickly, coal shortages will shut down much of the countrys industry.
Some of the 150,000 miners who went on strike last week in Siberias Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, and the rest went back today, strike leaders and the official Tass news agency said.
Gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed much of the blame for the miners deteriorating working and living conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions.
