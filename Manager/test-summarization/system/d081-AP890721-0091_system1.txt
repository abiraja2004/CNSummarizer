Some of the 150,000 miners who went on strike last week in Siberias Kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work Thursday, and the rest went back today, strike leaders and the official Tass news agency said.
The Coal Mining Ministry will continue to run the mines, but the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels and allocating the profits, he said.
In the largest coal region, the Donetsk Coal Basin of the Ukraine, more than 300,000 miners were on strike, the deputy minister of the coal industry, Alexander P. Fisun, told Izvestia.
Beginning Aug. 1, mines and other industries in the coal mining complex will gain the right to sell for negotiated prices in the USSR and abroad products which they make over and above the state plan, Tass quoted the agreement as stipulating.
