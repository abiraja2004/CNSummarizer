Run in high heat, high humidity, high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course, the Barcelona Olympic mens marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run.
Brace trains extremely carefully indeed.
I spoke to Britains Steve Brace, winner of the Paris marathon in 1989 and 1990, the Berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the Barcelona event.
In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a sell-out to commercialism.
He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regards Olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious about tomorrows slog.
