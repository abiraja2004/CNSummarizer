To put on the marathon in the late afternoon, rather than first thing in the morning (the normal practice), and then to make them run 4km up a hill is just criminal in my opinion, said Brasher, a former Olympic gold medal athlete and noted sportswriter.
In his opinion, gearing the marathon to prime-time TV viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a sell-out to commercialism.
Male marathon runners will face the same kind of problems with heat, humidity, and an over-demanding terrain, he said.
He agrees that the run will be highly demanding, and while he regards Olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career, he is cautious about tomorrows slog.
