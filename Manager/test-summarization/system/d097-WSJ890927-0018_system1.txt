Yet, some analysts believe Hugos huge losses will make a dent in the industrys capital and crimp cash flow; that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months.
Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it wont cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say.
In the last three years, hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild, so insurers havent had to dip into these funds.
Both USF&G and Cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge; USF&G said it would be responsible for the first $22.5 million of losses, and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses.
