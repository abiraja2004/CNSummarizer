For the time being, the losses from Hugo will be substantial, but they wont be something the industry cant handle, said Charles L. Ruoff, director of strategic planning at Fred S. James & Co., a New York-based insurance broker.
Niagara Exchange Corp., based in Buffalo, N.Y., said Monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter, and possibly for the year, because of the substantial losses that its Charleston Insurance Co. unit faces as a result of the hurricane.
Hurricane Hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far, but it wont cause property-casualty premium rates to rise immediately, analysts and company officials say.
