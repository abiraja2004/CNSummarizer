The obituary also praised Sakharovs vision as a scientist, which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Soviet dissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights award Thursday night during his first trip to New York City.
Past Soviet reports, published before Gorbachev became Soviet leader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and said the couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals between spouses.
Sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new 2,250-member Congress of Peoples Deputies, but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an Academy of Sciences seat.
Gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects Monday, when the funeral is planned, and on Sunday was represented by Yevgeny M. Primakov, chairman of the funeral commission and a non-voting member of the countrys ruling Politburo.
Sakharov arrived in the United States on Sunday to visit relatives and receive medical treatment before going to Washington for a White House visit and a board meeting of the International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity, of which he is a director.
