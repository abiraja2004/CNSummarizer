African National Congress officials said the dead child and her parents were distant cousins of Nelson Mandela.
Given the distant connection between Mandela and the family, police said they did not know if the attack was deliberate or just a random attack linked to the general violence.
ANC officials said the dead child was the great niece of Mandelas father, making her a distant cousin of Nelson Mandela.
Police Lt. Govindesamy Mariemuthoo said the attack occurred before dawn at the home of Monde Mandela in the black township of Soweto.
No group took immediate responsibility.
They denied South African police and press reports that the child was Mandelas great-granddaughter.
