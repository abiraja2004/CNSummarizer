Here are some quotes on Iraqs invasion of Kuwait: The Iraqi government firmly believes and states that Iraq is pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations with Kuwait.
We remain committed to take whatever actions are necessary to defend our longstanding, vital interests in the (Persian) Gulf.
The pretext to invade an independent, sovereign state is a false, flimsy pretext.
This kind of pretext, if its not going to be deterred in a decisive manner and by this august assembly, all international relations will be threatened.
Furthermore, it is the Kuwaitis themselves who will determine their own future and Iraqi forces will withdraw as soon as order has been restored.
