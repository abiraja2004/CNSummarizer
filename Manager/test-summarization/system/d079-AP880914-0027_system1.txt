The weakest hurricanes, Category 1, cause minimal damage with winds of 74 to 95 mph, 4-5 foot surge and pressure at 28.94 or more.
But because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course, no records are kept on their overall size, said center meterologist Jesse Moore.
The others were the 1935 Labor Day hurricane and Hurricane Camille, which bulldozed the Mississippi Coast with 172 mph winds and a 28-foot wave in 1969, leaving $1.4 billion in damage and 256 dead.
With tropical storm force winds extending 250 miles north and 200 miles south of the hurricanes center, Gilbert also was one of the largest.
