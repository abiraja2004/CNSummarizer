NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground.
A faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minutes before liftoff April 10.
The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discoverys electrical system until its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space.
Discoverys five astronauts returned Sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with NASAs most valuable and celebrated payload, the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope.
Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earths distorting atmosphere.
