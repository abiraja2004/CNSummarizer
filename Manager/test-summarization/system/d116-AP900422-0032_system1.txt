NASA has until Saturday to get Discovery off the ground.
NASA test director Mike Leinbach said Sunday that the countdown was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition.
It is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at Kennedy Space Center have been occupied simultaneously.
In some cases, it could be a problem having shuttles on both launch pads, Brand said.
The $100 million observatory also will focus during Columbias nine-day mission on Comet Austin, believed to be on its first trip through the solar system.
NASA expects to launch Columbia with an astronomical observatory called Astro no earlier than May 16, one week later than planned because of Discoverys two-week delay.
