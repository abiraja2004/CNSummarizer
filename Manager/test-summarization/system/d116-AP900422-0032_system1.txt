The six nickel-hydrogen batteries will power Hubble from the time it is disconnected from Discoverys electrical system until its two energy-collecting solar panels take over in space.
Discovery will aim for an altitude of 380 miles, the highest a shuttle has ever gone, so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above Earths distorting atmosphere.
