The coast guard official, who spoke in a Dutch radio interview, identified the ship involved as the Finnish-registered freighter Ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer.
Earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry, possibly one of the Dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the Dutch mainland.
They were taken ashore by a West German helicopter from the island of Borkum, about 30 miles from the site of the sinking, the official said.
It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified.
