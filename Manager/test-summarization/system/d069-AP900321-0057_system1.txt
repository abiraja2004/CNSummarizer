It will be the first meeting ever held on German soil by the World Jewish Congress, which was founded in 1936 in response to Hitlers threats against Jews.
Bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of anti-Semitism once the two Germanys are united.
For example, Germanys borders must be sealed in cement, and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons, he said.
Jews have a right to state a moral position on German reunification and we will make a moral statement.
I think that the place where they decided on the final solution is the right place to have such a meeting, and the anniversary of the victory in Europe seems to be the right day.
