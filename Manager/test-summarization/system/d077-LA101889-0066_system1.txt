A period of 83 years is short as far as earthquake intervals go, and during this time, scientists said Tuesday night, pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the San Andreas, which had not slipped as much.
But, as it was, Tuesdays quake was about four times stronger than the devastating Sylmar-San Fernando earthquake of 1971 and 10 times stronger than the 1987 Whittier quake.
Meanwhile, a New Mexico scientist who studies tidal forces, supported by two eyewitnesses, said Tuesday night that at a private lecture in San Francisco on Oct. 10, he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about Oct. 16.
