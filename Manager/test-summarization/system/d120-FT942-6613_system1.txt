John Major must, at some level, have appreciated the similarity between his own, strangely intangible, rise and that of Chaunceys.
Chauncey, played by Peter Sellers, utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the Republican partys power brokers that he is a sure-fire winner.
In case you did not see that marvellous film, this, in essence, was the plot: a man no one knows anything about, a gardener called Chauncey, rises without trace to become, by the end of the film, a serious candidate for the US presidency.
No wonder the young John Major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstances, no matter how fluctuating.
