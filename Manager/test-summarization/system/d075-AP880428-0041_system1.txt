New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.
Doctors from the University of Michigan Medical Center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early.
In the 1950s, doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack.
In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge.
