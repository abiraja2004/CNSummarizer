New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.
In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge.
When given quickly after a heart attack, TPA can dissolve clots in the hearts arteries and minimize damage.
However, people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others, and their medical bills were significantly lower _ $12,546 versus $17,868.
