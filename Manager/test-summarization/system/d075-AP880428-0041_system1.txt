In their paper, the doctors determined that 80 of the 507 heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge.
In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays.
New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.
The researchers estimated that if 15 percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days, the annual saving would be at least $280 million.
