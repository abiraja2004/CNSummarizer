The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore did not have a limited purpose, as required by the copyright act.
The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
The small Academy Award statue is part of the public domain, U.S. District Court Judge Laughlin Waters said in a ruling released Thursday.
We are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago, overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the Academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades, Malden said in a statement.
