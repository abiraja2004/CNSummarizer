The film industrys top award was distributed from the first ceremony in 1929 until about 1941 without the c mark indicating a copyright.
The Oscar statuette, one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world, has no copyright protection, a federal judge has ruled.
The decision was a setback for the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which had sued a Chicago-based manufacturer of an employee-incentive trophy similar to the Oscar.
The judge ruled, too, that the Oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry, and therefore did not have a limited purpose, as required by the copyright act.
