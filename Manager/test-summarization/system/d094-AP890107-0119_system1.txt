To many war victims, only now has World War II finally come to an end, said Gen. Ruud Boekholt, chairman of the August 15 Commemoration Foundation, a group representing 127,000 Dutch citizens who underwent Japanese internment.
President Reagan said Hirohitos 62-year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous, and yet at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind.
No one should go to that funeral from this country, said Ron Brown, a lawmaker of the opposition Labor Party, who denounced Hirohito as a war criminal of the worst kind.
Most historians believe Hirohito was a powerless figurehead but had approved orders that led to the attack on Pearl Harbor and put most of East Asia under an often brutal Japanese rule.
