Despite the low rating, Sundays game was seen by about 108.5 million people, making it the ninth most-watched TV show ever in the United States behind eight Super Bowls and the final episode of MASH.
The game on CBS averaged a 39.0 rating and a 63 share, the lowest Super Bowl rating since 1969, when the New York Jets 16-7 victory over Baltimore got a 36.0 on NBC for the worst rating ever, A.C. Nielsen Co. said today.
Last years San Francisco-Cincinnati Super Bowl, won by the 49ers 20-16, got a 43.5 rating and was seen in 39.3 million homes, according to Nielsen estimates.
