The musical Annie, which was on ABC opposite the game, got a 9.4 rating.
The highest-rated Super Bowl was in 1982, when the 49ers 26-21 victory over Cincinnati got a 49.1 on CBS.
The game on CBS averaged a 39.0 rating and a 63 share, the lowest Super Bowl rating since 1969, when the New York Jets 16-7 victory over Baltimore got a 36.0 on NBC for the worst rating ever, A.C. Nielsen Co. said today.
Despite the low rating, Sundays game was seen by about 108.5 million people, making it the ninth most-watched TV show ever in the United States behind eight Super Bowls and the final episode of MASH.
