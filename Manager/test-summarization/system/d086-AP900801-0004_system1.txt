Iraqi troops have launched an offensive against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
Iraq had moved about 100,000 troops to its border with Kuwait after claiming that Kuwaits production of oil beyond quotas of the OPEC cartel had depressed the world price, thus diminishing Iraqs revenue, and that Kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that straddles the border.
Kelly told a House subcommittee Tuesday that while the United States has no treaty obligations that would mandate military support for Kuwait, the United States does believe strongly in respect for territories of all states in the region.
Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah, Saudia Arabia aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis with neighboring Kuwait and complained that Kuwait was not negotiating seriously.
