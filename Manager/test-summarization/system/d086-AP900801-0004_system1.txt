Iraq then claimed Kuwait as part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred further action by Iraq.
Department spokesman Richard Boucher said Kelly repeated to the Iraqi envoy the U.S. desire for a peaceful solution to the tensions with Kuwait and urged Iraq to respect to sovereignty of all nations in the region.
Iraqi officials on Wednesday walked out on talks in Jiddah, Saudia Arabia aimed at resolving the 2-week-old crisis with neighboring Kuwait and complained that Kuwait was not negotiating seriously.
Iraq threatened to invade once before, in 1961 after Britain ended its protectorate over Kuwait.
