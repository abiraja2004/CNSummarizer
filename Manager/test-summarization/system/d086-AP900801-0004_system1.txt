Iraqi troops have launched an offensive against Kuwait, the Kuwaiti embassy said Wednesday night.
Kelly told a House subcommittee Tuesday that while the United States has no treaty obligations that would mandate military support for Kuwait, the United States does believe strongly in respect for territories of all states in the region.
Iraq then claimed Kuwait as part of its territory, but the appearance on the Kuwaiti side of the border of troops from Britain and other Arab states deterred further action by Iraq.
Faleh Bader, director of the ambassadors office, said, We confirm there is an offensive at Kuwait border and we have no comment.
