Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required and that Major was elected.
He was appointed to a junior ministerial post in 1985, then to the No.
We are going to unite totally and absolutely and were going to win the next general election, said Major, who emerged smiling from his residence at 11 Downing St. Major won 185 votes, former Defense Secretary Michael Heseltine had 131 votes and Foreign Secretary Douglas Hurd had 56 votes in a secret ballot election among Tory members of Parliament.
I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of our party, Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced.
