I congratulate John Major and thank him for a first-class campaign, fought without rancor or bitterness, which I believe lays the basis for the unity of our party, Heseltine said moments after the vote was announced.
Within minutes, Cranley Onslow, chairman of the Conservative Party committee that supervised the election, announced that another ballot was not required and that Major was elected.
He attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the Conservative Party, although his friends insisted that Majors own views are more liberal than many supposed.
He emerged as a possible heir-apparent when Thatcher appointed him foreign secretary in July, 1989, and then chancellor of the Exchequer three months later.
