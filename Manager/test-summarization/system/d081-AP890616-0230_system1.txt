When the miners saw that last night, that kind of set them off to where they decided to walk out, he said.
It will start whenever it comes down from the union president, Buchanan said.
Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but in the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout.
Some said they are asking union members to return to work, but Tommy Buchanan, international executive board member in UMW District 20 in Birmingham, Ala., said today the final decision on whether 5,000 Alabama miners will join the strike will be with union President Richard Trumka.
