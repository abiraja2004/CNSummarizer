When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
Udayan Ghose, an insurance industry analyst at Shearson Lehman Hutton in New York, estimates that Cignas third-quarter per-share earnings could be reduced by between 50 cents and 65 cents a share on an after-tax basis.
State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the companys record payout for a single disaster.
Philadelphia-based Cigna Corp. is expected to disclose Hugos likely impact on its earnings sometime today.
