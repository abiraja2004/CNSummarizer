State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance Co. said its State Fire & Casualty Co. unit estimates claim payments from Hugo will exceed $400 million in South Carolina alone, far surpassing the companys record payout for a single disaster.
When damages in North Carolina and Virginia are added, the company said, the payments will exceed $500 million.
It said that is more than three times the previous record of $165 million set by Hurricane Alicia, which hit the Houston-Galveston, Texas, area in 1983.
St. Paul Cos., based in St. Paul, Minn, said the pretax cost of Hugo shouldnt exceed $50 million.
Damage from Hurricane Hugo, which stormed through the Carolinas and the Caribbean last week, will reduce third-quarter earnings for several insurers.
