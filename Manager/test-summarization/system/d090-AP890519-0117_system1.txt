President Corazon Aquino on Friday refused to allow Ferdinand Marcos to return home to die and said her government wont permit him to be buried here despite a last appeal from his wife.
Mrs. Aquino had said earlier: I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos.
Mrs. Marcos said she was trying to contact the president to make a last appeal to Madame Corazon Aquino to open her heart and let Ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition.
