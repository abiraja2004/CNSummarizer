Mrs. Aquino had said earlier: I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos, if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration, because as I have said in the past, much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of Filipinos.
In a statement broadcast by a pro-Marcos radio station, Mrs. Marcos said she has tried to telephone Mrs. Aquino from Hawaii but was told the president was busy.
She said she has said in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here, and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incidents.
