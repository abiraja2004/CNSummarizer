About 20,000 people were evacuated from Puerto Progreso and other coastal towns, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry in Mexico City said by telephone Thursday.
The shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking place around the hurricane itself is getting better organized, more vigorous, so we think its starting to strengthen, said Bob Sheets, director of the National Hurricane Center in Miami.
It also left a half-million people homeless in Jamaica and caused widespread damage to the Cayman Islands.
At 11 p.m. CDT, the storm center was near latitude 22.8 north, longitude 94.4 west, or about 275 miles southeast of Brownsville, moving west-northwest between 12 and 15 mph, with maximum sustained winds of 120 mph and accompanied by a 5- to 10-inch rainfall, according to the National Weather Service.
