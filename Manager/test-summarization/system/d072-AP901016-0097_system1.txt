I was the new kid on the block and he stroked me and took care of me - and I will never forget him for that.
Larry Kert, who played Tony in the Broadway production of West Side Story, said Bernstein himself played the piano for him during rehearsals.
Flags at Lincoln Center, where the New York Philharmonic performs, were lowered in memory of the orchestras first American-born music director.
