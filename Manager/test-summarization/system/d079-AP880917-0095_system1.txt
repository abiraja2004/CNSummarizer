Gilberts remnants should bring very heavy rains to Rio Grande valley before heading north up the Mississippi River Valley as a huge rain-making machine, said Mark Zimmer, meteorologist at the National Hurricane Center in Coral Gables, Fla. The danger of flash flooding in Texas is very great, Zimmer said.
About 125 shelters holding 50,000 people were open in a four-county area of southern Texas around Brownsville, said American Red Cross spokeswoman Barbara Lohman.
To the south, about 300,000 people were homeless in Yucatan state and 10,000 more were homeless in Campeche, on the west coast of the peninsula, the government news agency Notimex said.
