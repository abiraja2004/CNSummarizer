The Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City confirmed the sinking and said a 40-year-old Spanish citizen, Vicente Daudi, was among the dead.
The embassy reported his wife, Rosa Maria Arnal, and a son survived the shipwreck, but two daughters were missing.
An official at the Puerto Barrios morgue said 13 bodies have been identified.
Juan Jose Gaytan, a reporter at Radio Portena in Puerto Barrios, said the Justo Rufineo Barrios II ran out of fuel midway on a regular 16-mile run from the town Livingston, across the bay, to Puerto Barrios.
Gaytan said the boat sank while it was being towed by a tugboat.
