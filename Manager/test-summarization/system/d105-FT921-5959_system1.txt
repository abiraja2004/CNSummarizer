TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants.
Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn.
Armenians in the enclave want unification with Armenia, but Azerbaijan will not give up any territory.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce.
The enclave is administered by Azerbaijan but largely populated by Armenians.
Marshal Shaposhnikov, who is also commander-in-chief, has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former Soviet Union.
