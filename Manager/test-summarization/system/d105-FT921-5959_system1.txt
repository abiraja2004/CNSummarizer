Troops under fire along the Armenian-Azerbaijani border will also be withdrawn.
TROOPS OF the former Soviet Union were ordered to pull out from the Armenian enclave of Nagorno-Karabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between Azeri and Armenian militants.
Commanders of the Trans-Caucasus military district, which encompasses Georgia as well as Armenia and Azerbaijan, have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the Commonwealth of Independent States defence minister, announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce.
The order for the pull-out of the 366th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between Armenian guerrillas and Azerbaijani forces.
