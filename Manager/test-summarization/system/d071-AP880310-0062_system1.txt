With no seats and no food for the guests of honor, everyone agreed that lunch at Sardis had gone to the dogs.
In all the arrests Ive made with him, hes only bitten four times.
He has helped the Police Department make hundreds of arrests and has apprehended more than 50 felons.
The Dog Fanciers Club organized the event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II, a fluffy little Pomeranian, and Nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a German shepherd.
But neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch from the luncheon at Sardis, a prominent midtown Manhattan restaurant.
Prince, said his agent and master Skip Piazza, doesnt have a very large diet anyway.
