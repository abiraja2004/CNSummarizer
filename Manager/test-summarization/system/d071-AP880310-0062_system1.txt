Nero was kept on his long leather leash while Prince emerged from his elegant, padded carrying case only long enough to pose for photographers.
But neither Nero nor Prince got any lunch from the luncheon at Sardis, a prominent midtown Manhattan restaurant.
With no seats and no food for the guests of honor, everyone agreed that lunch at Sardis had gone to the dogs.
The Dog Fanciers Club organized the event Wednesday to honor Champion Great Elms Prince Charming II, a fluffy little Pomeranian, and Nero, a big, amiable bruiser of a German shepherd.
Nero specializes in sniffing out bombs and narcotics.
