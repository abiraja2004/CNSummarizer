Waigels comments came after a day after a high-ranking official in Bonn warned that East Germany is rapidly approaching insolvency.
Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a sorrowful state and urged the East German government to release details on its financial situation.
He said the Bonn government believes East Germanys foreign debt stands at $18 billion.
The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank unit that had been stationed at a military base there with helicopters, ADN reported.
