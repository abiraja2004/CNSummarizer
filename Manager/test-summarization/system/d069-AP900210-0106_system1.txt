Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a sorrowful state and urged the East German government to release details on its financial situation.
If the situation has changed, the East German government must say so, said Waigel, a conservative who has been pushing for establishment of a common currency for the two states.
The protesters, from the East German town of Prenzlau, claimed the Soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank unit that had been stationed at a military base there with helicopters, ADN reported.
As the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of Plauen, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification.
