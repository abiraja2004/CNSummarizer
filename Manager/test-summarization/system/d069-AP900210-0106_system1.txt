If the situation has changed, the East German government must say so, said Waigel, a conservative who has been pushing for establishment of a common currency for the two states.
Earlier Saturday, West German Finance Minister Theo Waigel said the East German economy was in a sorrowful state and urged the East German government to release details on its financial situation.
About 20,000 East Germans, many carrying West German flags, demonstrated Saturday for speedy German reunification, the official East German news agency ADN said.
As the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of Plauen, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl said in Moscow that Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise to respect German reunification.
