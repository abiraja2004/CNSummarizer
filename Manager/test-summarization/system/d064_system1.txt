But despite the jolly opening ceremony - with Big Macs, musicians playing the balalaika, and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant M - life has been tough for McDonalds since it opened its first restaurant in Moscow 3 1/2 years ago.
Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonalds in the world the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to McDonalds management, who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.
In fact, this is a clash between the Big Mac and Pljeskavica, said an official of Genex, Yugoslavias largest state-run enterprise that will operate the McDonalds.
The joint venture agreement between McDonalds of Canada and the Moscow City Council calls for 20 restaurants, though there is no timetable or even a definite plan for when or where the second McDonalds will open.
The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonalds in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun.
The worlds largest McDonalds, with 27 cash registers and a seating capacity of 900, brings to Moscow not only hamburgers, french fries and shakes (called milk cocktails here), but also a living lesson in Western-style marketing.
