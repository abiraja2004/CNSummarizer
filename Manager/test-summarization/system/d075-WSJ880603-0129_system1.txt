The FDA persuaded aspirin makers in March to refrain from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks, at least for now.
Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value, the Food and Drug Administration said.
Taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some peoples chances of dying of other things, especially hemorrhagic strokes, the agency said in a commentary in todays Journal of the American Medical Association.
The FDA commentary pointed to 10 hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the 11,000 subjects taking aspirin in the recent study, compared with two such strokes among 11,000 subjects taking the substitute.
