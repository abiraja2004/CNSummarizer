[Reporter] How are you, Governor Chen?
We will definitely encounter more hardships and difficulties.
Over the past few days, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province have been bravely fighting the flood and have been making concerted efforts to provide disaster relief to afflicted areas, with the result that some of the provinces key dams have remained sound and economic losses have been reduced to a minimum.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and people fighting in the front lines of the provinces battle against the flood.
