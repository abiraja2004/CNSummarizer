We are full of confidence that, under the leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the broad masses of the Hunan Army personnel and people will be able to overcome the difficulties and hardships caused by natural calamities such as flooding, waterlogging, and so on and will win a complete victory in the on-going flood prevention and disaster relief struggle.
Under the current circumstances, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province should further step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the moment.
