Under the current circumstances, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province should further step up their work and devote more energy to flood prevention and disaster relief work, this being an overriding task at the moment.
I would like to take this opportunity to extend my warm regards and thanks to the broad masses of Army personnel and people fighting in the front lines of the provinces battle against the flood.
Over the past few days, the broad masses of Army personnel and people across the province have been bravely fighting the flood and have been making concerted efforts to provide disaster relief to afflicted areas, with the result that some of the provinces key dams have remained sound and economic losses have been reduced to a minimum.
