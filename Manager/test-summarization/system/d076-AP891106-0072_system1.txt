Mrs. Thatcher told The Sunday Correspondent in an interview published Sunday that she hoped to lead her Conservative Party to a fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try for a fifth.
If Mrs. Thatcher resigns while in office, her successor elected by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of Queen Elizabeth II, but convention dictates that he or she seek a mandate in a general election as soon as possible.
In an editorial today, the pro-Thatcher Daily Telegraph said Mrs. Thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating she would not seek a fifth term.
