If Mrs. Thatcher resigns while in office, her successor elected by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of Queen Elizabeth II, but convention dictates that he or she seek a mandate in a general election as soon as possible.
Mrs. Thatchers popularity is the lowest of any prime minister since opinion polls began in Britain 50 years ago, and senior colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief, Nigel Lawson.
Mrs. Thatcher told The Sunday Correspondent in an interview published Sunday that she hoped to lead her Conservative Party to a fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try for a fifth.
