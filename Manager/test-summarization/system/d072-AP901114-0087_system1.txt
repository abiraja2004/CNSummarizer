Singers were the Westminster Choir, mezzo-sopranos Marilyn Horne and Christa Ludwig, soprano Clamma Dale, tenor Jerry Hadley and baritones Thomas Hampson and Chester Ludgin.
The concert also included Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein works.
On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his Mass and Chichester Psalms.
And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16.
Speakers, introducing various selections and often quoting from Bernsteins writings, included Bernsteins three children, son-in-law and friends Lauren Bacall and Schuyler Chapin.
