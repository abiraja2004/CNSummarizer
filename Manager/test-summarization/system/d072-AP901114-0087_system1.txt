The concert also included Schumann, Haydn and Mahler as well as excerpts from six Bernstein works.
On the stage where Leonard Bernstein made his sensational New York Philharmonic conducting debut 47 years ago, the orchestra remembered the maestro at a concert that included selections from his Mass and Chichester Psalms.
And it was the 36th anniversary of the first TV broadcast by Bernstein, who died Oct. 16.
First chair musicians from the Boston Symphony, Israel Philharmonic, London Symphony, Santa Cecilia Orchestra and Vienna Philharmonic flew here, at their orchestras expense, to take part.
Conductors were Michael Tilson Thomas, Michael Barrett, Christoph Eschenbach and James Levine.
