If East Germany stays in the Warsaw Pact, NATO, with the best of its ability, would try to prevent full reunification; maybe a confederation between the two Germanys, but not a full reunification, Rogers says.
Brzezinski asks: How do we arrange for the unification of Germany, so that it doesnt become destabilizing, so it isnt a threat to Germanys neighbors _ France, Poland, Czechoslovakia?
Rogers notes that Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev has said the nations of eastern Europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the Warsaw Pact.
Reunification has been supported by NATO and by the United States for 40 years, and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of Germany must take place in peace and freedom, he said.
