The concept of a reunified Germany enjoys support from the United States and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic German superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout Europe.
It was just 2{ months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II, a time when a unified Germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than 50 million people.
While a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario, an undivided Germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent.
