In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milk and coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction.
Women dressed in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in the quake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and present their offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in the Hindu trinity.
Other helicopters ferried medicine, rice, cooking oil, clothes and tents to police trapped in the most remote regions of Bihar, Indias poorest state.
Some roads were flooded by heavy rains that continued Tuesday, while others had 3-foot-deep cracks or were blocked by boulders the size of houses in the Himalayan mountains and valleys.
