In Darbhanga, India on Tuesday, worshipers offered sweets, milk and coconuts to appease the Hindu god of destruction.
Most of the victims died in their houses, which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains.
British soldiers from a nearby Gurkha recruiting center pitched in with cranes to aid the demolition.
Women dressed in colorful saris gathered at countryside temples in the quake-ravaged areas of eastern Bihar state to pray and present their offerings to Lord Shiva, the god of destruction in the Hindu trinity.
The rumors started with anonymous telephone calls and spread by word of mouth.
