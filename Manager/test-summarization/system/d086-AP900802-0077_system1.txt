Iraq said in a statement that it had responded to the request from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it.
Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy artillery in their failed attempt to repulse them, Kuwaiti officials said earlier.
It said its troops _ no numbers were given _ were in Kuwait to defend the revolution and the Kuwaiti people.
Iraq, which reportedly massed about 100,000 troops at the border on Wednesday, has been engaged in a major defense buildup since Saddam came to power in 1979.
The crisis began July 17 when Saddam accused Kuwait of trying to wreck the debt-ridden Iraqi economy with oil overproduction and began massing troops on Kuwaits border.
