The crisis began July 17 when Saddam accused Kuwait of trying to wreck the debt-ridden Iraqi economy with oil overproduction and began massing troops on Kuwaits border.
Iraq also demanded the Kuwaiti island of Bubiyan, which is opposite Iraqs only outlets to the Persian Gulf.
Iraq said in a statement that it had responded to the request from interim government of free Kuwait and decided to cooperate with it.
The invasion came a day after talks between Kuwait and Iraq collapsed in Jiddah, Saudi Arabia.
Kuwaiti forces had engaged the Iraqi invaders with heavy artillery in their failed attempt to repulse them, Kuwaiti officials said earlier.
