To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time.
I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.
The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was designed to do.
And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked to varied.
A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
