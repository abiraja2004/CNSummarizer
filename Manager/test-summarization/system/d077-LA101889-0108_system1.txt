And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget.
To me, the earthquake was not as bad as the Whittier quake in October, 1987, mainly because I was awake this time.
A few people were running out of the stadium, but there did not seem to be great alarm, because the quake did not last long.
I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.
It was shortly after the network went on the air.
The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was designed to do.
