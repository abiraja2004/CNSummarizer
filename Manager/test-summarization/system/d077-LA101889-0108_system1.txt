The stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint -- one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage -- was doing was it was designed to do.
And anyone who was at Candlestick Park Tuesday night for Game 3 of the World Series will never forget.
It was opening and closing as if the place was made of cardboard instead of concrete.
I was in a trailer just outside the stadium, about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit.
Most people stayed in their seats, waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed.
And later, when fans started leaving en masse, the reaction of those I talked to varied.
