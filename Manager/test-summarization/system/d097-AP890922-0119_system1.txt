As Hugos wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows, reporters wandered in and out of Rileys office.
Later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the City Council chamber.
While Hurricane Hugos 135 mph wind roared outside, Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. watched the fury it vented on his beloved, 300-year-old city.
Riley, city officials and a few reporters stayed in Charlestons historic City Hall through Thursday night as the areas worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the Civil War began.
