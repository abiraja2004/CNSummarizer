To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing, said Saturday Night Live comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after the I Love Lucy show went off the air as a regular series.
Her co-presenter was Bob Hope, who a few hours after her death said simply, God has her now, but thanks to television, well have her forever.
Another neighbor, Bob Rosati, said he was watching a rerun of I Love Lucy when the screen went black and the words In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989 appeared.
We (the staff) always kept in touch with how she was doing and kept up with all the gifts and cards she received, because it was like they were for a family member, she said.
