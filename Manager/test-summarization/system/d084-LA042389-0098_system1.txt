Walter Thorp said Saturday it will take as long as 10 days to complete the pathology process on the remaining 35 sailors who died when gunpowder exploded in the No.
Although autopsies are not conducted at the base as a matter of policy, the Navy requested forensics exams for each of the sailors.
As Navy officials continued their inquiry into the explosion, sailors aboard the Wisconsin, sister ship to the Iowa, opened their ship Saturday in Norfolk, Va., to talk about their pride in battleships and the sense of loss.
Alan Dooley said a team of six investigators was aboard the ship, searching for clues to the blast.
