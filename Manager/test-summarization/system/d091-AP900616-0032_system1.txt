John and Sue Wright, whose home rests on the banks of Pipe Creek, estimated they lost about $20,000 worth of property.
Fink said he feared there wouldnt be enough funeral homes to handle the dead in this eastern Ohio town of 4,300 people.
People moved rubble and made makeshift repairs to bridges that span McMann Creek, which links homes to Ohio Route 147.
The shock had not worn off, said police officer Bruce Fink, whose bristly face bore signs of more than 20 hours on duty, including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home.
Cement blocks were all that remained of homes, fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy streams meandered through the outskirts of this Ohio River town after a furious flash flood.
