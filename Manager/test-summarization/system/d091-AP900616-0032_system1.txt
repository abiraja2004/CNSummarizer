Fink said he feared there wouldnt be enough funeral homes to handle the dead in this eastern Ohio town of 4,300 people.
Cement blocks were all that remained of homes, fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy streams meandered through the outskirts of this Ohio River town after a furious flash flood.
At least 170 members of the Ohio National Guard were called in to patrol and to help rebuild flood-swept roads, said Stacie Gilg, a spokeswoman for the Ohio Emergency Management Agency.
Belmont County Sheriff Tom McCort said he suspected many of the vehicles belonged to sightseers.
