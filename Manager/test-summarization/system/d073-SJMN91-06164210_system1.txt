Punongbayan said Tuesday that the site was in the path of the volcanic flow from Mount Pinatubo during its last major eruption, in 1380.; About 19,000 Filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near the volcanos slopes and were housed in 25 makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger zone.
It was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and a third, smaller blast at 11:49 a.m.; The huge plume could be seen in Manila, 60 miles to the south, and reporters at the scene said it blocked out the sun.
; About 10 people in Moraza, a village on the western slope of the mountain, were refusing to leave, relief officials said.
