The Bush administration is expected to name career diplomat Harry Shlaudeman as the first U.S. ambassador to Nicaragua in almost two years, a U.S. official says.
They took the action as a means of expressing opposition to the Reagan administrations friendship toward Mozambiques Marxist government.
He told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally by President Bush.
The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives.
He retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a State Department liaison with the Nicaraguan Contra rebels.
