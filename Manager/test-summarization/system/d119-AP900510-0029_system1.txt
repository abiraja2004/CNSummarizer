The administration is eager to have an ambassador in Managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that U.S.-backed President Violeta Chamorro has taken over after almost 11 years of rule by the leftist Sandinista party.
The administration had planned to send another career diplomat, Melissa Wells, to Managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged Senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives.
In addition to his ambassadorial posts, Shlaudeman was the top Latin America aide to President Ford in the mid-1970s and a diplomatic trouble-shooter in Central America under President Reagan.
