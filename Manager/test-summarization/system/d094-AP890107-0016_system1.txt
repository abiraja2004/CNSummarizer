Speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and obviously nervous monotone, Hirohito, the spiritual and titular leader, offered his opinion for the first time.
He was never seen in public wearing traditional Japanese garb, and a palace official confided that the Emperor of Japan did not even own a kimono.
The emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out Japans military adventures in the 1930s and 1940s.
But it was his first effective decision as emperor, and his most courageous, that ended the Pacific conflict.
It was the first time Hirohito had ever gone to see anyone, and the first of several calls on the general who had led the Pacific war against Japan and became its postwar governor.
