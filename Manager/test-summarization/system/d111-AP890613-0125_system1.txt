A yacht built for Adolf Hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the Voyage of the Damned was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane, officials said Tuesday.
Its also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels heading to the port of Miami and has been marked with a flashing buoy, he said.
Coast Guard Lt. Al Crespo said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef, threatening damage to coral and sponges.
If its not, the government will remove it and bill Resnick.
Cadley denied that, saying he only agreed to meet Daly off the coast.
