Mr. Sifri says the emphasis will be on developing McDonalds image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class, rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in South Korea.
However, the competition is heating up, and there is a good possibility that South Korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket, an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry says.
Analysts say this years rise could be much bigger, helped by a 25% increase in wages in mid-1987 and another big pay increase expected soon.
Hamburger-related fast-food sales in South Korea totaled $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, according to the Ministry of Finance.
