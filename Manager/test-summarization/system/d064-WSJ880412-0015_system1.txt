Hamburger-related fast-food sales in South Korea totaled $87.5 million last year, a 30% rise from 1986, according to the Ministry of Finance.
The business is likely to profit from the 1988 Olympic Games in Seoul in September, and from an anticipated post-Olympic economic boom here.
However, the competition is heating up, and there is a good possibility that South Korea already has reached the fast-food saturation point for its current average income bracket, an official for the South Korea Chamber of Commerce and Industry says.
Equally modest, he says, will be the initial menu: no breakfast, no Chicken McNuggets and no products tailored to national tastes, as offered elsewhere.
