Despite the tension, officials from both sides said the incidents did not appear to be serious.
Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but says it will back any movement for self-determination by Kashmirs people.
Singh said directors of military operations from both countries were in touch.
Singh, who is also defense minister, said exchange of fire also occurred Tuesday.
Singh told Parliament that Indian armed forces were fully prepared to effectively deal with any eventuality.
India and Pakistan have gone to war twice over Kashmir, in 1965 and 1971.
There was no report from India on the alleged firing.
In Pakistan, a Defense Ministry spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said Tuesday that Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchanged artillery fire in the Kel sector along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Pakistani and Indian regions.
