There is no cause for any undue concern since we trust that these localized incidents will be contained and the situation defused, United News of India quoted Singh as saying in the Parliament.
Pakistan, an Islamic state, denies the charge but says it will back any movement for self-determination by Kashmirs people.
In Pakistan, a Defense Ministry spokesman, who cannot be identified under briefing rules, said Tuesday that Indian and Pakistani soldiers exchanged artillery fire in the Kel sector along the cease-fire line dividing Kashmir into Pakistani and Indian regions.
The Pakistani official also said that on Monday and Tuesday, Indian soldiers fired on Pakistani civilians traveling on a mountain road, injuring four people.
