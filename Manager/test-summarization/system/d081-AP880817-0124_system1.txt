Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said there were no reports of violence and police made no attempt to move into the mine, which is 280 miles southwest of Warsaw and employs about 9,000 workers.
Andrzejczak said the Morcinek miners broke off talks with management when they were refused access to loudspeakers and contact with the strikers at July Manifesto.
In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and launched their own occupation strike.
He said miners erected a large Polish flag atop the administration building and were blocking the complexs main entrance.
