In support of an estimated 3,000 colleagues striking for a second day at the July Manifesto mine in Jastrzebie, workers at the nearby Morcinek mine refused today to take up their tools and launched their own occupation strike.
The strike committee issued a communique today saying the workers would not end their stoppage until their demands are met and charged: The mine management is trying to end the strike by hunger.
Port workers in Szczecin and southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition activists said.
The second strike came as Solidarity strike committee members met with management and representatives of the Industry Ministry at the July Manifesto colliery.
