Port workers in Szczecin and southwestern coal miners today declared sympathy strikes with miners demanding the legalization of Solidarity, opposition activists said.
Also Tuesday, security officials briefly detained 10 Solidarity activists at the Rudna copper mine near the city of Wroclaw in lower Silesia.
Port workers occupied the docks in Szezecin, about 250 miles northwest of Warsaw, and set up a 15-member strike committee, said Jan Kostecki, a leader of the independent union federation.
Solidarity adviser Jacek Kuron said there were no reports of violence and police made no attempt to move into the mine, which is 280 miles southwest of Warsaw and employs about 9,000 workers.
