The New Right activist Paul Weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with A Lady Not His Wife.
Sen. Sam Nunn, Mr. Towers successor as Armed Services Committee chairman, seemed initially to smile on the nomination; then the rumor mill started churning and he changed fronts.
I dont so much resent my rejection by the Senate, Mr. Tower insists, as the way it was done.
Once, meeting with the editors of my newspaper which had backed him strongly, he thought nothing of tilting back in his chair, crossing his tiny, well-shod feet atop the conference table.
The nominee issued fervent denials: He drank only wine, having long since sworn off scotch; hed never chased secretaries; his services for defense-industry clients had been proper and modest.
