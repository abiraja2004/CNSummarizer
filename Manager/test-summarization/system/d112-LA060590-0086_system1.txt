Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be Gannetts USA Today, Tribune Co.s New York Daily News or the Chicago Sun-Times.
The Daily News has one of the United States largest circulations, but in recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation in a market with three other dailies.
Maxwells comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in New York of Maxwells Berlitz International and were confirmed later by a spokesman for Maxwell Communications, the investors London-based holding company.
Other industry officials conjectured that Maxwell might be talking to the Chicago Sun-Times, which has seen daily circulation slide more than 100,000 papers, to about 533,000, since 1985.
