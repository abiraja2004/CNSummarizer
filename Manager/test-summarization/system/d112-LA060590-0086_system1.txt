Maxwells comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in New York of Maxwells Berlitz International and were confirmed later by a spokesman for Maxwell Communications, the investors London-based holding company.
The Daily News has one of the United States largest circulations, but in recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation in a market with three other dailies.
Maxwell declined to identify the newspaper, but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be Gannetts USA Today, Tribune Co.s New York Daily News or the Chicago Sun-Times.
Maxwell has already been in negotiations with USA Today officials about printing the paper for U.S. distribution.
