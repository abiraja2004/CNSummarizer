Wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character, which debuted in a 1937 full-length cartoon film.
Ironically, the academy is extremely protective of the Oscar name and statuette copyrights and is quick to object to the images unauthorized use.
We have great respect for the academy and for all that it does, Frank Wells, Disneys president and chief operating officer, said Thursday in a prepared statement.
At that point, the Disney statement said, the academy, through a legal representative, denied to Disney that the Academy Award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of Disney, without revealing the academys intention to feature Disneys Snow White.
