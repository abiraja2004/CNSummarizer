Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
Iran has told the United Nations that the death toll is at least 36,000, but Gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 100,000.
Sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting, flag-waving rally participants, who also carried signs criticizing their native country.
Planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake, but part of the Fridays activities focused on Irans stricken residents.
Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
