Gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life.
As Gobadi spoke Friday, members of the organization denounced Irans government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the White House.
Gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring Iraq and against internal opposition.
There were many, many victims before this tragedy and there are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of the United States, he said.
