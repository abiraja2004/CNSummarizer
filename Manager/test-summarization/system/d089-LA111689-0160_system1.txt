It came in with a huge roar, an enormous amount of water, and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of, said real estate broker Ike Carroll, who was in his car when the twister struck.
Mayor Steve Hettinger said 14 deaths had been confirmed, with 285 people injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while city streets were filled with rush-hour traffic.
He said two people were killed when the twister hit house trailers in rural areas east of Huntsville.
Several people are still trapped in vehicles and apartment complexes and shopping areas, said police spokesman Ben Jennings after the twister touched down between 4 and 4:30 p.m. in this northeastern Alabama city.
