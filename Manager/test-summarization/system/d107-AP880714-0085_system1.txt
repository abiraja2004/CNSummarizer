Weather forecasters today were offering drought-stricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next 30 days and three months.
The outlook also says theres a 55 percent chance of hotter than normal temperatures through the U.S. heartland from New England to Idaho and from the Canadian border to Oklahoma.
The separate drought impact assessment, issued by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrations Climate Office, points out that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing, since dry spells have no normal lifetime.
That puts the current drought on the same level as the one in 1911, but still less severe than the droughts of 1936, 1931, 1956 and 1934.
