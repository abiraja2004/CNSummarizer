After Wednesdays deployment, Shriver gently backed Discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers, the last one completed this morning, to park Discovery in orbit 46 miles behind Hubble.
On Wednesday, mission specialist Steve Hawley used the shuttles 50-foot robot arm to gently grasp the 12{-ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay.
Hubble project manager Fred Wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened.
Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
