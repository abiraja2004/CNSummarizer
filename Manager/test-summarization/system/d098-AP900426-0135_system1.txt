We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, said NASAs Dave Drachlis.
Steve Terry, director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope, said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem.
Scientists have hailed the Hubble _ NASAs most expensive unmanned spacecraft _ as the greatest advance in astronomy since Galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly 400 years ago.
Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
