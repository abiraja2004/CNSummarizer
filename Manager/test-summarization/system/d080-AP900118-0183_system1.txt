The system is not going to protect children, said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didnt testify in the case.
I tell my children all the time ... there is no such thing as fair, said Robert Currie, whose son attended McMartin but didnt testify at the trial.
Ira Reiner has had that case for five years, and I am not going to take any public criticism directed at me.
I fear that because of this verdict, no child will be seen as a credible witness from now on.
...Not only for the families, the children in this case, but also for the defendants as well.
