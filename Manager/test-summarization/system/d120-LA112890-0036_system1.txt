During the past few days, Major picked up strength among his colleagues, as opinion polls showed him to be the next most popular Tory after Heseltine nationwide.
He has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and, associates said Tuesday night, lead the Tories to victory in the next election, which must be held within 18 months, at a time of the partys choosing.
The prime minister had picked Major from among backbenchers -- those who are not party leaders -- as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him, aides said, as a man of the people.
