That speech led Heseltine, who had walked out of the Cabinet in 1984 in a dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor, to challenge Thatcher for the leadership in that first ballot last Tuesday.
With 185 votes in the three-way race, Major did not gain as many as the 202 votes Thatcher won Nov. 20, when Heseltine was her sole opponent.
But in that vote, under the partys complicated rules, she needed a majority plus 15% and she fell four votes short.
Labors Cunningham declared that the Conservatives lead was a temporary blip and promised to fight an election as soon as he (Major) names a date.
