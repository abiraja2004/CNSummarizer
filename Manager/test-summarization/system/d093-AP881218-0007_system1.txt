The news service said the passengers were 183 students and teachers from a high school and primary school in Qiongzhong County, who were going to take the ferry to visit a hydroelectric power station.
The move followed the July 21 capsizing of a ferry on the Min River in Southwestern Sichuan province in which 133 people died, and the July 25 sinking of a passenger boat on the Yangtze River in which 71 people drowned.
The 183 passengers and four crew members enormously exceeded the ferrys capacity and the ship capsized Wednesday before it had sailed 200 yards, the report said.
