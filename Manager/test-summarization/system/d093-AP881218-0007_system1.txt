An overloaded ferry taking schoolchildren on a field trip capsized and sank in southern China, killing 55 people and leaving seven missing, the China News Service said in a dispatch seen Sunday.
On September 22, another overloaded ferry sank in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region bordering Vietnam, leaving 61 people dead and one missing.
The news service said the passengers were 183 students and teachers from a high school and primary school in Qiongzhong County, who were going to take the ferry to visit a hydroelectric power station.
The 183 passengers and four crew members enormously exceeded the ferrys capacity and the ship capsized Wednesday before it had sailed 200 yards, the report said.
