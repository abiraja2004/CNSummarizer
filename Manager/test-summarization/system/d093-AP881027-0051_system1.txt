About 200 passengers were wounded when the pirates fired rifles and hurled homemade bombs before making off with about $83,000 in local currency, police said.
The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said.
The ferry that sank was carrying more than double its authorized capacity of 100 passengers, police said.
Fifteen bodies were recovered and 94 people were reported missing in the sinking Wednesday night where the Ilisha and Tetulia rivers meet and join the Meghna, police and a district administrator said.
