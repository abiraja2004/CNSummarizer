The pirates, who had boarded the ferry as passengers, opened fire and exploded bombs shortly before midnight Tuesday as people were bedding down for the night, Chandpur police said.
Police said six bodies were found in the hull of the ferry, the M.L.
About 200 passengers were wounded when the pirates fired rifles and hurled homemade bombs before making off with about $83,000 in local currency, police said.
They said 44 of the injured passengers were hospitalized, including four in critical condition.
Another ferry was attacked by river pirates near Chandpur late Tuesday, police said.
More than 100 people were feared drowned after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern Bangladesh, police said today.
