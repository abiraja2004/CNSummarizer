Sunday at Royce Hall, the American Youth Symphony has added local composer Leon Levitchs Elegy for Strings -- a personal choice from conductor Mehli Mehta -- to the program to honor Bernstein, who died last Sunday.
I was proud to be associated with him at the New York Philharmonic and the Israel Philharmonic Orchestra, both of which he considered family.
In addition to the Leonard Bernstein tribute that is part of the Los Angeles Philharmonic program this weekend, other local orchestras are also planning special remembrances.
Also, opening the new season of the Glendale Symphony season on Sunday at Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, music director Lalo Schifrin will observe a moment of silence to honor his longtime friend and colleague.
