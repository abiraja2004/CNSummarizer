Tass said that after Gorbachev noted that nationalist passions benefit all anti-perestroika forces, he suggested increasing accountability in Soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife.
Tass said Gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions, including an increase in power for each of the countrys 15 republics, a law on equal use of the more than 100 languages spoken in the Soviet Union and some economic autonomy for the countrys republics and regions.
The Soviet leader told a meeting of the Communist Party leadership that inter-ethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country, due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups.
