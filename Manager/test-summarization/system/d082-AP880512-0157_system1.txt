Moscow News said Sakharov was stubborn, unassuming, an undisputed member of his countrys intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life.
He simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy, Moscow News said.He calls perestroika (restructuring) an enormous event for our country and for the entire world.
Much of the Moscow News article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the Sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them.
Soviet media once branded Andrei D. Sakharov a traitor, but a Moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife.
