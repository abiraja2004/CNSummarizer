The motion picture industrys most coveted award, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuettes have been produced so far.
From 1942 to 1944, the trophy was made of plaster, but winners were later presented with the real thing.
According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the only engraving mistake was in 1938 when the best actor trophy given to Spencer Tracy for Boys Town read: Best Actor: Dick Tracy.
The Academy holds all the rights on the statue and reserves the right to buy back an Oscar before someone takes it to a pawn shop, said Academy spokesman Bob Werden.
