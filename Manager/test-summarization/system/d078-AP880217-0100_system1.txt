The motion picture industrys most coveted award, Oscar, was created 60 years ago and 1,816 of the statuettes have been produced so far.
According to the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences, the only engraving mistake was in 1938 when the best actor trophy given to Spencer Tracy for Boys Town read: Best Actor: Dick Tracy.
From 1942 to 1944, the trophy was made of plaster, but winners were later presented with the real thing.
Weighing 8{ pounds and standing 13{ inches tall, Oscar was created by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer studios art director Cedric Gibbons, who went on to win 11 of the trophies.
