Ethnic violence killed 148 people and wounded 885 this month in the Central Asian republic of Kirghizia, the official news agency Tass said Wednesday.
Maj. Gen. Alexander Grienko, chief of the Interior Ministrys Political Department, said that in two years of civil strife _ mainly ethnic clashes _ in the Soviet Union, about 24,000 people have been arrested.
He said in Moscow on Tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in 13 regions of the Soviet Union because of such outbreaks, Tass said.
The argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated region where housing is scarce.
No new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of Osh in western Kirghizia, where clashes arising from a land dispute began on June 2 between ethnic Kirghiz and Uzbeks, both Sunni Moslems.
