Tajik communists leader Shodiy Shabdolov told ITAR-TASS on Monday [16 May]that the disintegration of the Soviet Union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics.
Radical market reforms imposed by quasi- democrats and wild privatisation have enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of the population in poverty and hunger, he said.
The mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed inter-ethnic conflicts in many ex-Soviet republics and outburst of nationalism.
He stressed that it will act within the framework of the law and use only constitutional methods.
