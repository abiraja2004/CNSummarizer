Kuwaiti spokesman Nasser Al-Sabeeh said before the formal meeting that Kuwait wants negotiations with Iraq to be mediated by the Arab League.
Kuwaits ambassador to the United Nations, Mohammad Abulhasan, denied the invasion was in response to a call from help from a new government.
Kadrat said the events were related to an internal matter that was not the councils concern.
It specifically endorsed mediation efforts by the Arab League, which met in emergency session in Cairo today.
Britains U.N. envoy, Crispin Tickell, condemned the invasion as an ugly moment in world affairs.
The Iraqi government firmly believes and states that Iraq is pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations with Kuwait, said Kadrat.
