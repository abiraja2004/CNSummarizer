The time has come for us to show our allies, but also reform-minded people in the East, that German reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about.
Dorothee Wilms, Bonns cabinet minister for inter-German affairs, said in an interview in the newspaper Welt am Sonntag that recent polls show that between 85% and 90% of all West Germans favor a reunifed Germany.
The recent escape movement from the DDR makes especially clear that people of both German states want to live free amongst themselves, she said, but cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight.
