Earlier Sunday, Rushlaw and his three team members missed winning the first U.S. bobsled medal in 32 years when they was beaten by .02 seconds for the bronze.
The best America could do was six medals, its worst Winter Games showing in 52 years.
The Soviets finished first in both number of gold medals, with 11, and total medals, with 29, a record for the Winter Olympics.
The Olympics wrapped up Sunday evening with a rousing closing ceremony before 60,000 people in McMahon Stadium.
Athletes marched in carrying miniature Olympic torches, and banners reading Until We Meet Again in eight languages were draped along the top of the stands.
