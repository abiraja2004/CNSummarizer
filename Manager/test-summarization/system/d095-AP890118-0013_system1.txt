Patrick E. Purdy purchased an AK-47 rifle in this Portland suburb several months ago, then returned to his hometown of Stockton, Calif., where he used the gun to kill five children and wound 29 others, along with a teacher, at Cleveland Elementary School before taking his own life, authorities said.
I dont understand why and I probably wont ever know why, said Ms. Chumbley, a 63-year-old retired cannery worker.
He later moved to Lodi, Calif., where he listed his mailing address under the name of his grandmother, Julia Chumbley, although he did not live with her, authorities said.
Her next-door neighbor, Pat Thomas, 45, said she met West when he lived with his relatives last summer.
