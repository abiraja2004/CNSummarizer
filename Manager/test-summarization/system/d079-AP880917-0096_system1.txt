Hinojosa Cortina said about 3,000 refugees from La Pesca were sheltered in Soto la Marina but other coastal residents had not been evacuated or decided to ride out the storm.
The center said rainfall of 10 to 15 inches was accompanying the storm with up to 20 inches locally.
The storm was moving west-northwest at about 12 mph, and was expected to follow that track through midday today before turning gradually to the northwest, forecasters said.
Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
