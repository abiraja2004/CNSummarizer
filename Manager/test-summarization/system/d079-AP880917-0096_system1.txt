The flooding occurred in Monterrey, an industrial city of 3 million people, located 110 miles from the Texas border and 140 miles inland from Matamoros.
At 9 a.m. EDT today, Gilberts center was located near latitude 25.1 north and longitude 100.3 west, or 185 miles west southwest of Brownsville and 40 miles south of Monterrey, said the National Hurricane Center in Florida.
Rains from Hurricane Gilbert sent a river raging over its banks in Monterrey, sweeping at least 10 policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from Matamoros, police said today.
In Matamoros just across the Rio Grande from Brownsville, the storm felled trees, downed power lines and flattened dozens of tin shack homes on the evacuated beachfront.
