To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing, said Saturday Night Live comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after I Love Lucy went off the air as a regular series.
Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of I Love Lucy on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989 appeared.
Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the I Love Lucy characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.
