To baby boomers, a happy chunk of our childhood is missing, said Saturday Night Live comedian Victoria Jackson, who was born two years after I Love Lucy went off the air as a regular series.
What she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime.
Miss Goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the I Love Lucy characters to Hollywood, where Lucy and Ethel spotted actor William Holden in a restaurant.
Although Miss Ball hadnt visited her hometown of Jamestown, N.Y, since 1956 and had no family there, she had stayed in touch with friends.
