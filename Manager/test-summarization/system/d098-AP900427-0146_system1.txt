Those problems, however, were not the immediate concern of shuttle Discoverys astronauts, who prepared for Sundays return to Earth.
Terry said Hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods.
The Hubble Space Telescope orbited with its big eye open Friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover, but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction.
Ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift even though the telescope was in an automatic safe mode, with all motion stopped because of problems in linking its high-speed dish antennas with a relay satellite.
