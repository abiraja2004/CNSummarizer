The FBI is trying to determine whether Tower, who left the Senate in 1985 after 24 years, received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of Unisys Corp., sources said Friday.
Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former Unisys executive Charles F. Gardner, said to be a central figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation.
-- A longtime Bush political adviser said that Bush knew what he was doing when he named Tower to the post and would not withdraw the nomination, despite the controversy.
