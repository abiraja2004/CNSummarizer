The sworn deposition about Towers business dealings was never filed in court because Tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife, Lilla Burt Cummings.
Federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that Tower was aware that his 1984 campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former Unisys executive Charles F. Gardner, said to be a central figure in the Pentagon bribery investigation.
Dr. R. D. Dignan, who performed surgery to remove a polyp from Towers colon on Jan. 5, said that after the operation he advised Tower to limit his drinking to one or two glasses of wine with dinner.
