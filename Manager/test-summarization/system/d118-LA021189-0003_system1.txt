The FBI is trying to determine whether Tower, who left the Senate in 1985 after 24 years, received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of Unisys Corp., sources said Friday.
In the deposition, Tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid $8,000 a month.
A Unisys spokesman said Friday that the company was conducting an internal inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current corporate employees.
Towers Testimony Tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed only by the American unit of British Aerospace and that he worked chiefly on selling the companys commercial jets to U.S. airlines.
