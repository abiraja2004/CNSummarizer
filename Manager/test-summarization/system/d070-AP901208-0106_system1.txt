I demand that the Soviet government immediately release Erich Honecker and extradite him to German justice officials, the Osnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohls Christian Democrats, as saying.
Federal lawmaker Johannes Gerster said refusal to turn over the deposed East German leader for trial could burden Bonn and Moscows outstanding relations, the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper reported.
Honeckers fate is one of the first issues facing Bonn and Moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer together.
A ranking member of Chancellor Helmut Kohls party demanded the Soviet Union hand over Erich Honecker, who is wanted by German authorities on manslaughter charges, a newspaper reported on Saturday.
