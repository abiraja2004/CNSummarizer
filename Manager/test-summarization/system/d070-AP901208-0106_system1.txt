I demand that the Soviet government immediately release Erich Honecker and extradite him to German justice officials, the Osnabrueck newspaper quoted Gerster, a member of Kohls Christian Democrats, as saying.
Federal lawmaker Johannes Gerster said refusal to turn over the deposed East German leader for trial could burden Bonn and Moscows outstanding relations, the Neue Osnabruecker Zeitung newspaper reported.
Soviet officials have said Honecker is staying at the hospital for humanitarian reasons, and German police need permission from the Soviets to gain entry.
A Berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for Honecker, 78, on the manslaughter charges.
He is accused of issuing shoot-to-kill orders to East German guards at the now-fallen Berlin Wall.
