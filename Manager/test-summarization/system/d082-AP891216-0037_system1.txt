The obituary also praised Sakharovs vision as a scientist, which made him the youngest-ever member of the Academy of Sciences at age 32 and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the Soviet hydrogen bomb.
The Soviet leader told reporters at the Congress of Peoples Deputies that Sakharovs death was a great loss.
However, the signatures of several other Politburo members, including KGB chief Vladimir A. Kryuchkov and leading conservative Yegor K. Ligachev were missing.
In what amounted to a public apology, Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Soviet leaders today eulogized Andrei D. Sakharov as a man of honesty and sincerity who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers.
