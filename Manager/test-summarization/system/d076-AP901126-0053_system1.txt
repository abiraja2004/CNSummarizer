The truth is that although Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, she doesnt believe in the advancement of women, Clare Short, a Labor Party lawmaker, said last month.
For some, it was enough that her political career reached the heights.
Jo Hawkins of the 300 Group, which is seeking equal numbers of women in the House of Commons, believes Mrs. Thatchers extraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand the needs of the average woman.
She believed the battle for womens rights had been largely won and was no believer in feminism.
Angela Rumbold, the Conservative Partys minister for womens issues, contends that an enormous amount has been done for women during the Thatcher years.
