Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did little else to help women along.
One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatchers successor would hold, since he couldnt be called prime minister, thats a girls name.
Trree men are vying to succeed her as Conservative Party leader and thus prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for Tuesday.
Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the Cabinet.
