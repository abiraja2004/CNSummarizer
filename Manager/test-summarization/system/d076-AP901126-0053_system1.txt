Margaret Thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in British society, but her critics say she did little else to help women along.
One woman wrote to The Independent newspaper last week that her 7-year-old daughter wondered what title Mrs. Thatchers successor would hold, since he couldnt be called prime minister, thats a girls name.
She believed the battle for womens rights had been largely won and was no believer in feminism.
Edwina Currie, a former junior health minister, said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the Cabinet.
The truth is that although Mrs. Thatcher is a woman, she doesnt believe in the advancement of women, Clare Short, a Labor Party lawmaker, said last month.
