Mr Cosmas motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
The regions coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants, which together account for only 4 per cent of the countrys electricity capacity, could also be run using lignite and gas.
According to the ministry, if the miners pay demands were met, the cost of their coal would double.
In recent months, Mr Cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power.
