Mr Cosmas motive for calling the strike - for which, surprisingly, he has the support of RAH, the state-owned coal mining company - are less obvious.
In recent months, Mr Cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials, including President Ion Iliescu, called miners to Bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power.
They are also following the call of their charismatic leader, Mr Miron Cosma, the man who led them on protests to Bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases.
According to the ministry, if the miners pay demands were met, the cost of their coal would double.
