Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discoverys delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
The ships five-member crew is set to blast off at 5:31 a.m. PDT Tuesday, 14 days after the flight was grounded just four minutes before takeoff by a faulty hydraulic power steering unit.
Commander Loren J. Shriver, 45; co-pilot Charles F. Bolden, 43; Steven A. Hawley, 38; Bruce McCandless, 52, and Kathryn D. Sullivan, 38, plan to launch the telescope Wednesday.
With Discoverys launch processing on track, engineers worked to ready Columbia for its May 16 Spacelab astronomy mission.
Five hours later, Discoverys five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
