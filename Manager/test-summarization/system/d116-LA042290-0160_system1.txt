Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a May flight.
Five hours later, Discoverys five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discoverys delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
