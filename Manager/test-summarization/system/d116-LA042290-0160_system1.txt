Five hours later, Discoverys five-member crew was scheduled to fly in from the Johnson Space Center in Houston to make final preparations for launch.
Discoverys replacement auxiliary power unit was successfully test fired Wednesday and the battery charging for the telescope was completed Thursday, one day ahead of schedule.
Engineers also readied the shuttle Columbia for rollout to its launch pad today for a May flight.
The National Aeronautics and Space Administration has not had two shuttles on the launch pad since Columbia took off Jan. 12, 1986, with Challenger poised on a pad 1.7 miles away.
Countdown clocks resumed ticking Saturday for the shuttle Discoverys delayed launch Tuesday to boost the $1.5-billion Hubble Space Telescope into orbit.
