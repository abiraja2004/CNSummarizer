It also is considered by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date; it will be the 35th.
Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
Astronaut Steven A. Hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the 24,250-pound telescope into space on the second day of the mission.
From its perch far above Earths obstructing atmosphere, the telescope will be able to discern objects 50 times fainter and with 10 times greater clarity than the best ground-based observatory.
