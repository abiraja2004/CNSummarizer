It also is considered by many at NASA to be the most important shuttle mission to date; it will be the 35th.
Two weeks after a failed launch attempt, an improved Discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions, hoisting the Hubble Space Telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time.
Nothing, at least scientifically, seems to have been lost as a result of the two-week wait, one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original 1983 launch date.
After the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done, Hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two.
