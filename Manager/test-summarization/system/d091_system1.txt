Gaston Caperton said Sunday he had no precise dollar figure on damage from flooding Friday along a five-mile stretch near New Martinsville and in nearby Ohio County, but estimated it will run into millions of dollars.
Some of the bodies were taken to a funeral home that set up a temporary morgue in Shadyside, about 10 miles south of Wheeling, W.Va. Officials from Ohio, West Virginia and the U.S. Coast Guard were searching the Ohio River for survivors and bodies, and Badia said National Guardsmen were to continue searching the creeks throughout the night.
The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
County Sheriff Tom McCort, who said he was running the recovery effort, said 51 people in Shadysville and Meade Township, where the two creeks run south of the village, were missing as of 8:45 p.m.
The death toll from last weeks flash floods mounted to 21 today when a body was found in the Ohio River, and authorities said there was little hope for the 14 people still listed as missing.
Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River.
