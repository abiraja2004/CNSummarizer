Its a shock after working very closely with her and loving her for over 35 years, said Miss Balls frequent sidekick, Gale Gordon, who was in Edmonton, Alberta.
Miss Ball also played a bag lady in the 1985 TV movie Stone Pillow, considered one of the most challenging roles of her career.
Miss Balls real, onscreen pregnancy marked a milestone in television, and an estimated 44 million viewers _ more than for the inauguration of President Eisenhower _ tuned in on Jan. 19, 1953, to watch Lucy Ricardo have Little Ricky.
Miss Ball, with her fire-engine red hair and siren wail, was considered the queen of situation comedy and a pioneer of the sitcom format.
