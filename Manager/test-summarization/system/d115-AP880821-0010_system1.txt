Officials in both countries predicted the death toll would rise after they received reports from remote areas which were hit harder.
Srivastava said the quake lasted about one minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour.
At least 1,000 people were injured when the quake triggered landslides and house collapses in Bihar and the surrounding states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, all heavily populated, largely agricultural areas.
Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses, said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border.
