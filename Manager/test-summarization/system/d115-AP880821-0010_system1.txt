Most of them (were) buried alive under collapsed houses, said Indra Shrestha, a social worker involved in the rescue operation in Dharan Bazar, a township of about 100,000 people about 18 miles from the Indian border.
At least 1,000 people were injured when the quake triggered landslides and house collapses in Bihar and the surrounding states of Uttar Pradesh, West Bengal and Orissa, all heavily populated, largely agricultural areas.
In Indias Bihar state, communications with Darbhanga, which appeared to be the worst-hit area, were disrupted.
Shrestha said rescue operations were being hampered by the monsoon rains, which hit the subcontinent in late June and usually last through September.
