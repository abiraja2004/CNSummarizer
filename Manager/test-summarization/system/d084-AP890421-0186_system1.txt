Karl Johnson, an Atlantic Fleet spokesman, said the Navy would not release the exact position of the ship, which was expected to reach its home port here about 5:30 p.m. Sunday.
The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions that crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.
The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun, the newspaper said.
