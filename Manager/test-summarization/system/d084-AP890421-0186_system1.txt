The Navy released photographs of the firefighting effort, which authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool off the turret before anyone could enter it.
During the trip home, investigators on board were reviewing a videotape of the turret taken by an Iowa officer who had wanted to record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred, said Lt. Cmdr.
The Washington Post reported in its Saturday editions that crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces.
