The Pentagon said the blast ripped through the middle gun of the three-gun turret, and that that gun had not been fired prior to the explosion.
The Navy released photographs of the firefighting effort, which authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool off the turret before anyone could enter it.
The explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun, the newspaper said.
After the fire was extinguished, crew men worked quickly to remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they could explode, the newspaper said.
