It was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking 29 miles off the Dutch island of Ameland, according to the coast guard spokesman, who was not identified.
The ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel, gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the Argentine Esperanza station near the tip of the Antarctic Peninsula, the National Science Foundation said in a statement released in Washington.
It is known that two years earlier, Hitler ordered the German pocket battleship Graf Spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of Montevideo, Uruguay, and attacked by British ships.
In the 1941 battle, the Bismarcks main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking British ships were out of range of her secondary guns, Ballard said, so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits _ its sinking clearly inevitable.
The sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same remote-controlled robot that Ballard used four years ago to find the wreck of the Titanic, the British passenger liner that sank in 1912 after striking an iceberg.
British ships picked up 110 survivors but left with hundreds of German sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a German U-boat.
