Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those athletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race of life that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.
He was always the fastest, said Bush, recalling the afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.
The Berlin Games were to be the showcase of Hitlers theories on the superiority of the master race until this 23-year-old kid showed up, Bush said.
The late Jesse Owens, whose performance at the 1936 Olympics put the lie to Hitlers boasts of racial superiority, picked up a fifth gold medal Wednesday for humanitarian contributions in the race of life.
