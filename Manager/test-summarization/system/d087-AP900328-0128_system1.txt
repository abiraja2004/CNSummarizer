Bush, borrowing a phrase from Ruth Owens, said it was not those athletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race of life that earned Owens the Congressional Gold Medal.
President Bush presented the Congressional Gold Medal to his widow, Ruth Owens, in a ceremony at the White House also attended by three daughters and teammates of the track legend.
He was always the fastest, said Bush, recalling the afternoon in May 1935 when the Ohio State runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of 45 minutes.
He said the athletes legacy lives on through the Jesse Owens Games, a playground Olympics; the Jesse Owens International Trophy for amateur athletes and the Jesse Owens Foundation, which awards scholarships to needy youth.
