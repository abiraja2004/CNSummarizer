You cant swim out there that long in the Ohio River.
One body was found Sunday in debris along Wegee Creek, about three miles from where it meets the river, said Belmont County coroners investigator Chuck Vogt.
That brought the confirmed death toll in Thursdays floods to 19, including five children.
The digging will continue at least through Tuesday, Fire Chief Mark Badia said.
