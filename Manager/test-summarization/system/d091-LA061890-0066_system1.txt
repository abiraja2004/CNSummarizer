The debris broke loose, and thats when we got three big gushes of water, he said.
The digging will continue at least through Tuesday, Fire Chief Mark Badia said.
One body was found Sunday in debris along Wegee Creek, about three miles from where it meets the river, said Belmont County coroners investigator Chuck Vogt.
Badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks, forming dams at each bridge.
The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio increased to 19 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
