The computer models Schneider uses show that in a worst-case scenario, over the next 100 years the worlds temperature could jump by 10 degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas _ which both contribute to the greenhouse effect _ continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked.
The greenhouse effect may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future, storms up to 50 percent stronger than Hugo and last years record-setting Gilbert, some meteorologists say.
But if the seas warm up, say by 3 to 6 degrees Fahrenheit, the wind speeds might be 25 percent higher _ which means the destructive force would be more like 50 percent higher, he said.
