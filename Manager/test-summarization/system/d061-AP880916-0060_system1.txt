If that happens in an area where theres plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Bleck said.
Hurricane Gilberts growth from a harmless low pressure zone off Africa to a ferocious killer in the Gulf of Mexico was fueled by a combination of heat, moisture and wind that baffles forecasters.
Its a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time, Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.
Gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters Sept. 3 as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of Africa.
