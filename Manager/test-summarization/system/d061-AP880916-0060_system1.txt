If that happens in an area where theres plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere (the bottom 10,000 feet or so), this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation, Bleck said.
Their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere, he said.
Its a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time, Gil Clark of the National Hurricane Center said Thursday.
That strengthens it, he said, adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the Earths rotation.
And they know that development is sparked when winds converge, and that growth is affected by time and place.
