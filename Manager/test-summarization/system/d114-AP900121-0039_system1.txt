At least 47 people have been killed in Jammu-Kashmir state since the beginning of the year in violence triggered by Moslem militants demanding independence or union with Islamic Pakistan.
Srinagars 800,000 people are moslty Moslem, as is a majority of population in the Kashmir region.
Troops battled mobs of Moslem separatists in the Kashmir city of Srinagar over the weekend, and at least 21 people were killed and 100 wounded before the fighting subsided Sunday night, police said.
Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the death toll was at least 30, but that figure could not be confirmed.
The curfew order was one of the first acts of the new governor, Jagmohan, a tough administrator who had cracked down on Kashmiri militants during an earlier stint as the states governor.
