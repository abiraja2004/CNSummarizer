A 24-hour curfew was imposed Saturday in a bid to quell escalating violence and mass anti-India demonstrations in Srinagar and nearby towns.
The curfew order was one of the first acts of the new governor, Jagmohan, a tough administrator who had cracked down on Kashmiri militants during an earlier stint as the states governor.
Some took up a chant urging mujahedeen, or Islamic holy warriors, to prepare for the final sacrifice in a showdown with Indias Hindu-dominated government.
The dispute started when the state was partitioned between the two countries when they gained independence from Britain in 1947.
Srinagars 800,000 people are moslty Moslem, as is a majority of population in the Kashmir region.
