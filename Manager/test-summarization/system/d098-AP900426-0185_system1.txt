Controllers sent information to the telescope about its location, and this basically improved the telescopes knowledge where it was, what its position was, said Goddards Dave Drachlis.
The problems wont delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. Now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do differently in the future to make it continue to work, Boggess said.
Space shuttle Discovery trailed 57 miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the Hubbles aperture door was opened, set for Friday morning.
