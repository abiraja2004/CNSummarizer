It lasted only 45 minutes and was due to human error.
Controllers sent information to the telescope about its location, and this basically improved the telescopes knowledge where it was, what its position was, said Goddards Dave Drachlis.
We have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite through the high-gain antenna system, Drachlis reported.
The mission would be extended a day if the space walk became necessary.
In addition, one of four rate gyros, wheels whose spin maintains the telescope in a stable position, was disconnected by an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain immediately.
