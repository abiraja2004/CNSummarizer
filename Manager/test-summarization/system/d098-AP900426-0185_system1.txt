Controllers sent information to the telescope about its location, and this basically improved the telescopes knowledge where it was, what its position was, said Goddards Dave Drachlis.
When the door covering the telescope aperture is opened, starlight will strike the telescopes finely polished 94.5-inch mirror for the first time.
The mission would be extended a day if the space walk became necessary.
The problems wont delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use, said Jean Oliver, Hubble deputy project manager at Marshall Space Flight Center in Huntsville, Ala. Now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do differently in the future to make it continue to work, Boggess said.
