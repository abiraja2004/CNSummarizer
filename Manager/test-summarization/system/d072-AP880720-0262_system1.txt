The Bernstein weekend alone, with tickets as high as $5,000 each, may bring in more than $1 million for the festivals endowment fund, according to Caroline Smedvig of the symphony.
Beverly Sills, who announced last month that she will step down as general director of the New York City Opera, will be the host of the event.
The season of classical music will be expanded with performances by such popular rock, jazz and folk artists as The Beach Boys, George Benson and Leo Kottke.
Other highlights of the new season include several major debuts, including that of Soviet painist Vladimir Feltsman, who arrived in the United States last August after an an eight-year battle to emigrate; a return visit by the Israel Philharmonic; and a recital by Irish flutist James Galway.
