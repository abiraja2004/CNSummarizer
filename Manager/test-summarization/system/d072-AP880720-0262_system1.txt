Aug. 27 will be given over to a performance of Bernsteins Mass by a 250-member troupe from the Indiana University school of music.
The season of classical music will be expanded with performances by such popular rock, jazz and folk artists as The Beach Boys, George Benson and Leo Kottke.
The following night, Ozawa and special guests will appear in a Music Shed concert for a performance intended to show Bernsteins influence on other musicians.
Beverly Sills, who announced last month that she will step down as general director of the New York City Opera, will be the host of the event.
