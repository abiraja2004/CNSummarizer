The Leonard Bernstein Gala Birthday Performance is a four-day affair beginning on the composers 70th birthday, Aug. 25, to raise money for the music center.
Other highlights of the new season include several major debuts, including that of Soviet painist Vladimir Feltsman, who arrived in the United States last August after an an eight-year battle to emigrate; a return visit by the Israel Philharmonic; and a recital by Irish flutist James Galway.
The four-day celebration concludes with Bernstein conducting the annual Serge and Ola Koussevitzky Memorial Concert, including a performance of Tchaikovskys Symphony No.
The Tanglewood Music Center also is celebrating the 50th anniversary of its Music Shed this summer with a special concert by the resident Boston Symphony Orchestra featuring the same music, Beethovens Ninth Symphony, that inaugurated the building in 1938.
