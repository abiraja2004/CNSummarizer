Regarding the work in the next stage, he pointed out: We should continue to take flood fighting and relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously do a good job of reform, opening up to the outside world, stability, other fields of work, and industrial and agricultural production.
He said: In fighting floods and doing relief work, the broad masses of cadres and people in Zhuzhou and Xiangtan sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of industrial and mining enterprises, the Beijing-Guangzhou Railway, the 107 National Highway, and cities and thus minimized the losses caused by floods.
