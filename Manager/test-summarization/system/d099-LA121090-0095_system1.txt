It was the second marathon in two weeks that Kurtis, 38, has run, and almost won.
Martinez said entered this event because he knew the field was weak and his chances were good.
The only recurring theme in Martinez and Smiths backgrounds -- other than the 26.2 miles they ran -- was that they are novices at long-distance running, this was their first victory at this distance and that they are both teachers.
Smith said she and Ireland ran together -- they even chatted -- through the 20-mile mark, until Smith got her feet working faster than her mouth.
Smith earlier this year ran the Long Beach Marathon, where she finished seventh but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year.
