Beijing, 21 Jun (XINHUA) -- According to the State Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters, after the largest or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of China occurred a few days ago in the Xi Jiang, Bei Jiang, Xiang Jiang, and Gan Jiang rivers, water levels in these rivers are dropping slowly; however, high water levels will remain in these rivers for the next few days.
A flood peak occured in Bei Jiang in Guangdongs Sanshui at 0400 on 20 June, raising the water level to 10.39 meters -- the largest flood level ever recorded.
Drops in water levels in Guangdongs Bei Jiang and Xi Jiang do not mean that Guangdongs flooding situations have eased, because flood waters in the Xi Jiang and Bei Jiang will remain at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea after the two flood waters jointly flow through the low-lying Zhujiang Delta.
