At Parks College in Cahokia, Ill., eight miles south of East St. Louis, aircraft hangers were twisted and flattened and small aircraft tossed around the airport by high winds, the National Weather Service said.
Severe thunderstorms also developed over Alabama and South Carolina during the afternoon, and the weather service reported a tornado north of Greenwood, S.C. Other showers and thunderstorms, with locally heavy rain, were widely scattered along the northern Atlantic Coast.
Wind up to 65 mph damaged roofs, power lines and trees in parts of Kentucky and Louisiana, the weather service said.
Thunderstorms sweeping across Tennessee spun off a tornado in southeastern Madison Country, and dropped hail as big as baseballs north of Jackson, the weather service said.
