The sentence for criticizing Saddam is death, and the president considered Kuwaits oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to Iraq.

Iraqs 100,000 troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make Kuwait capitulate to Iraqs demands.
