Since Sept. 19, when he was confined to intensive care after vomiting blood, Hirohito has received 42 pints of blood in transfusions.
News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito has shed much of his normal 104 pounds during his confinement and now weighs about 66 pounds.
Emperor Hirohito has lost nearly 40 pounds in the two months since he fell ill and now weighs only 66 pounds, a palace official was quoted as saying Friday.
The emperor responds to queries from aides but is less talkative than before, Maeda told reporters.
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine days.
