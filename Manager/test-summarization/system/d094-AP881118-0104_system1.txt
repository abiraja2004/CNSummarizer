Emperor Hirohito has lost nearly 40 pounds in the two months since he fell ill and now weighs only 66 pounds, a palace official was quoted as saying Friday.
Palace officials have not given details on Hirohitos illness, and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.
The 87-year-old emperors condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had stopped internal bleeding in his upper intestinal area, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
The emperor responds to queries from aides but is less talkative than before, Maeda told reporters.
News reports quoted Maeda as saying Hirohito has shed much of his normal 104 pounds during his confinement and now weighs about 66 pounds.
