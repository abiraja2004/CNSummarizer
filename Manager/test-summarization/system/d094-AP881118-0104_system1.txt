Emperor Hirohito has lost nearly 40 pounds in the two months since he fell ill and now weighs only 66 pounds, a palace official was quoted as saying Friday.
Hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine days.
The 87-year-old emperors condition weakened Friday, but doctors speculated that a scab had stopped internal bleeding in his upper intestinal area, said Imperial Household Agency spokesman Kenji Maeda.
He added that doctors sometimes have trouble determining whether Hirohito is awake.
Palace officials have not given details on Hirohitos illness, and they would not comment on Japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer.
