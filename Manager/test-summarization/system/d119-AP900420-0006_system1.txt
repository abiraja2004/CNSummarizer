Wells nomination as ambassador to Mozambique in 1986 encountered strong opposition from Senate conservatives who held up the appointment for 11 months in protest against U.S. policy toward that country.
But a new era in U.S.-Nicaraguan relations is expected to open with the inauguration of Mrs. Chamorro, who defeated President Daniel Ortega in elections this February.
In choosing Ms. Wells, the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region, said the sources, who asked not to be identified.
They also said the administration is eager to have more women in key posts.
The administration has asked Congress for $300 million in assistance to Nicaragua, part of which would be used for resettling Contra rebels.
