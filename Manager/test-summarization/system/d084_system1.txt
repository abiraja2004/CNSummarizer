The scarred battleship USS Iowa made a somber return Sunday to its home port, where about 3,000 family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed 47 sailors.
During the trip home, investigators on board were reviewing a videotape of the turret taken by an Iowa officer who had wanted to record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred, said Lt. Cmdr.
The Times cited unidentified sources as saying this indicated the explosion occurred while the bags containing 550 pounds of propellant powder were still being loaded into the gun.
Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that cooks off _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.
Meanwhile, NBC News reported that the exact cause of the blast in one of the ships three 16-inch gun turrets on Wednesday may never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so complete.
Crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen, according to a report in todays editions of The Washington Post.
