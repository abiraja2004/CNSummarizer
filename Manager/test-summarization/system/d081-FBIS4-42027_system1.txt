A rally consisting of 350 miners was held on 28 June near the town council building where demands were made to pay the wages and dismiss the director general of the Ordzhonikidzevuhillya production association.
On 28 June, 118 of 258 workers on the second shift at the PivdennoDonbass mine of the Donetskvuhillya production association in the town of Ugledar refused to start work for the same reasons -- delay in paying wages.
In the opinion of the mines representatives, who wished not to be identified, the strike has a clear political hue -- to attempt to compromise the existing authorities and, particularly, President Leonid Kravchuk before the second round of presidential elections.
