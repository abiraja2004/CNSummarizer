Iranian editorial writers are rejoicing now that the world is waking up to one of their most hated bogeymen: Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
With its sheikh a stateless person, and its powerful dinar which bankrolled the Iraqi military mere garbage, Kuwait is a nonentity, swallowed up by the dangerous pet it reared.
According to Irans pundits, the Great Satan planned it all.
Despite all the attention to the dangerous pet, the Great Satan has not been forgotton.
The status of Great Satan was reserved for the United States, the all-encompassing public enemy No.
In fact one of his reasons for invading Kuwait on Thursday, the Iraqi press noted, was its gall in demanding back tens of billions of dollars loaned to Iraq during the war Saddam says he fought for all Arabs.
