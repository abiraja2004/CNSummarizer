Forecasters said the hurricane was gaining strength as it passed over the ocean and would dump heavy rain on the Dominican Republic and Haiti as it moved south of Hispaniola, the Caribbean island they share, and headed west.
The hurricane center said small craft in the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico should remain in port until conditions improve.
The forecasters said the Dominican Republic would get as much as 10 inches of rain yesterday, with similar amounts falling in Haiti last night and tonight.
In the Dominican Republic, all domestic flights and flights to and from Puerto Rico and Miami were canceled.
