Bush, surrounded by 49ers, told the team, With this, your third Super Bowl title in eight years, you rewrote the record books and raised the game of football to a new level of excellence.
And, to Montana, who drove the team to the winning touchdown on a 92-yard drive late in the fourth quarter, Bush said: Joe, you once again showed your grace under pressure.
And outgoing coach Bill Walsh gave Bush a 49ers jogging outfit, but cautioned, Im not sure we suggest running in the streets of Washington, D.C., in this suit....Remember the Redskin fans are all around us.
Bush was presented autographed balls by both Montana and wide receiver Jerry Rice, who won the games Most Valuable Player award.
