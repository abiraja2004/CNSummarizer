The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.
In the Iranian quake, the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time, just after midnight.
The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earths crust meet, he said.
Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
