In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
The quake struck an area of Iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse, Needham said.
The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
Most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit.
The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earths crust meet, he said.
