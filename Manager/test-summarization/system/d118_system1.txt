But a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, who asked not to be identified, said Friday that the new allegation, if true, suggests that the former Texas senators drinking problem may be ongoing and that his confirmation remains in doubt.
The bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of Tower, a 24-year Senate veteran who headed the Armed Services panel from 1981 to 1985.

The Democratic-controlled Senate today rejected the nomination of former Texas Sen. John Tower as defense secretary, delivering a major rebuke to President Bush just 49 days into his term.
Over the course of many years, I have encountered the nominee in a condition -- lack of sobriety -- as well as with women to whom he was not married, conservative activist Paul M. Weyrich told the Senate Armed Services Committee.
Johnston said his reading of the FBI report on Tower leaves him with the clear impression that Towers personality changes when he drinks heavily, leading to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober.
