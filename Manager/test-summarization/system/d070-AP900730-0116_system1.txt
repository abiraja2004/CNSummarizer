The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials, who had been among Honeckers closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
It said former secret police chief Erich Mielke, former economics czar Guenter Mittag and former labor chief Harry Tisch were under arrest, while the other four remained free.
But a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition to be questioned and to stand trial, ADN said.
Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
