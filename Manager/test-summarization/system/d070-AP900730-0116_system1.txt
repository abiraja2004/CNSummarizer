East Germanys deposed Communist leader Erich Honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried, the official news agency ADN reported Monday.
Honecker, 77, ruled East Germany for 19 years until he was ousted in October as a wave of pro-democracy demonstrations swept the country, leading to the peaceful overthrow of the Communist government and the opening of the Berlin Wall.
The medical panel concluded that seven other former Communist officials, who had been among Honeckers closest aides, were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody, ADN said.
ADN quoted Federal Prosecutor Guenter Seidel as saying he intended to continue his investigation against the former East German leaders, although their poor health often disrupted the proceedings.
