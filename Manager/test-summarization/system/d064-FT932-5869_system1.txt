Although the first Moscow restaurant is the busiest McDonalds in the world the plunging rouble, high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to McDonalds management, who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial Dollars 50m investment.
Mr Viktor Khlystun, the agriculture minister, praised the fact that McDonalds gets most of its supplies from inside Russia after setting up a Dollars 45m processing plant outside Moscow.
McDonalds proven determination to be here for the long term and to serve Russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for Russian gratitude.
