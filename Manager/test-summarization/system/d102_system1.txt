In 1967, with Desilu churning out a gold mine of televisions hits, Star Trek and Mission: Impossible among them, an exhausted Miss Ball decided that she had had enough.
From her star-struck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the 1930s and 40s to the television career that made her a legend, Miss Balls life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches.
Miss Balls personal favorite episodes were filmed when she was pregnant with Desi Jr. An amazing 44 million viewers, 90% of the television audience, gleefully watched on Jan. 19, 1953, when she gave birth on film to the shows little Ricky.
Bob Rosati, who lives down the street from the Beverly Hills home Miss Ball shared with husband Gary Morton, said he was watching a rerun of I Love Lucy on Wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words In Memory of Lucille Ball, 1911-1989 appeared.
Born to an electrician father and pianist mother on Aug. 6, 1911, in a suburb of Jamestown, N.Y., Miss Ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the first.
Her timing, wails and pratfalls had made the I Love Lucy show one of the most popular in television history.
