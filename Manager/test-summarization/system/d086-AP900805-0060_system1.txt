Should the U.N. Security Council impose comprehensive sanctions, it would be the first time since 1967 it has taken such action against a member state.
Western diplomats said they expected up to 14 positive votes on the 15-member council for sanctions against Iraq.
British Ambassador Crispen Tickell told reporters later that he detected strong support, with the exception of one member, for action and a vote tomorrow.
Cuban envoy Ricardo Alarcon said Cuba would vote for sanctions against Iraq only if the council imposed sanctions on South Africa for occupying Namibia, Israel for occupying Palestinian territories and the United States for invading Panama.
