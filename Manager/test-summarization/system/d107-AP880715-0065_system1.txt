Experts said Thursday that the greenhouse effect _ the warming of the Earths atmosphere _ has brought needed attention to changes in the global climate, even though it is not directly related to the drought.
There is some evidence that as Jupiter goes around the sun at its fastest point, there are drought conditions in the Southeast in the months of April and October, Georgia state climatologist Gayther Plummer said.
He said the 1988 drought, although not as dry as a 1986 drought in many places, has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers.
However, Alan Hecht, director of the National Climate Program in Washington, D.C., said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects, especially undertaking policies that make sense in their own right.
