Wen Jiabao highly commended Jiangxis servicemembers and people for their spirit that stresses fostering unity and coordinated efforts, striving to help and rescue themselves, and continually fighting when encountering extraordinarily disastrous floods.
While continually and properly conducting flood-fighting and relief work along the Ganjiang River valleys, we should stress flood-prevention in the Poyang Lake area and should promptly organize the masses in the disaster-stricken areas to resume production so as to be self-reliant and to rebuild their homes.
Wen Jiabao pointed out: At present, the Ganjiang Rivers water-level is declining, but the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and government are still facing very arduous tasks.
