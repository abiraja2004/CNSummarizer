They will further inspect the flood situation and extend sympathy and solicitude to flood victims there.
The same evening, Wen Jiabao and his party earnestly listened to reports by the Jiangxi Provincial Party Committee and government on Jiangxis flood situation and its flood-fighting and relief work.
They inspected the flood situation along the Ganjiang River, visited the masses of flood victims, and extended greetings and appreciation to the servicemembers and civilians who have been performing rescue and emergency tasks.
While continually and properly conducting flood-fighting and relief work along the Ganjiang River valleys, we should stress flood-prevention in the Poyang Lake area and should promptly organize the masses in the disaster-stricken areas to resume production so as to be self-reliant and to rebuild their homes.
