The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescopes instruments.
Hawley began the long process of releasing Hubble shortly after 4 a.m. PDT when he grasped the Hubble with Discoverys 50-foot-long mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the 12 1/2-ton telescope high above the shuttle.
Before astronaut Steve Hawley was able to lift the 12 1/2-ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttles mechanical arm, its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttles power and shifted over to the batteries.
The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earths distorting atmosphere.
