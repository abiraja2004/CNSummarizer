We have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed, the telescope control center in Maryland said.
The orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the Earths distorting atmosphere.
The event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away as the telescope, glinting in the sunlight, drifted off on its 15-year search for new worlds.
The final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescopes instruments.
Deployment of the starboard panel, however, was more troublesome.
