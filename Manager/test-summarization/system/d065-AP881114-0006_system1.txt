Relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe GOP areas, Quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role _ going to political gatherings and state funerals _ rather than the advisory role that Walter Mondale and even Bush had, some scholars feel.

And although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news, he played the role of loyal No.
Quayle says Bush has talked to him about heading a space council, and that he assumes hell have a role in the administrations anti-drug efforts.
