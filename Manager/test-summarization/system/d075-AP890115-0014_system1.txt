However, Weisfeldt, who is president-elect of the heart association, also cautioned that much work remains, both in improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health.
Association figures indicated that in 1986 _ the most recent year for which there are statistics _ an estimated 978,500 Americans died from heart attacks, strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels.
The associations figures show that more than one in four Americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease, and almost half of those eventually die from it.
This treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart attacks.
I believe we can prevent at least 50 percent of the ischemic heart disease in the United States by the year 2000 if we stop smoking, get cholesterol treated if its above 220, and identify and treat hypertension, he said.
