With that kind of exposure to a potential 12 million Southern Californians, its no wonder that in only five years the L. A. Marathon has become the best-marketed, slickest, most modern and sponsor-driven of the worlds major marathons.
And that may yet transform this race, if -- as marathon President Bill Burke said this week -- the total purse of $202,520 is increased by $100,000 next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes.
The race has Mercedes-Benz of North America as its presenting sponsor, making it one of 10 companies that have not only paid the race organizers to be called sponsors, but have also put more money into the race either outright or by providing products and services.
