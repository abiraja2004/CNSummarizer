Nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred Saturday night and early Sunday when troops, firing randomly into large crowds, smashed through barricades to reach Tiananmen square and attack demonstrators demanding democratic reforms.
Some officials of Chinas Red Cross said 2,600 people were killed but Beijings Red Cross office has refused to provide any figures.
An Eastern European diplomat, whose country has good relations with China, insisted that 12,000 people were slain by soldiers as they attacked protesters in Tiananmen Square.
Victims were taken to dozens of hospitals, clinics and homes, and there is no indication the government will reveal many details of the tragedy.
