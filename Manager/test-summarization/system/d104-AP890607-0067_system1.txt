There were rumors that after the square was cleared troops burned many corpses in large bonfires and other bodies were removed by helicopters and garbage trucks to minimize the death count.
State Council spokesman Yuan Mu said on Tuesday that 7,000 people, including 5,000 soldiers, have been injured and 400 other soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded.
Victims were taken to dozens of hospitals, clinics and homes, and there is no indication the government will reveal many details of the tragedy.
Yuans statement said only 23 of the 300 people fatally injured were students.
Probably fewer than 10,000 people were in the square when the troops moved in and most were able to escape unharmed.
