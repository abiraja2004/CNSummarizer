And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign.
We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.
As I said at the start, Dan Quayle is a man I know and trust.
And almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem.
I knew Corinne Quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along, too.
And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagans vision of America into the law of the land.
