We are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the Republican Party, a man I am proud to say is my colleague, the junior senator from Indiana, Dan Quayle.
And for the purpose of debate only, I yield the balance of my time to the outstanding, distinguished senior from Indiana, my good friend, Sen. Dick Lugar.
And believe me he is ready, and just let the Democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign.
And I just dont believe the American people want that kind of experience in the White House.
And whenever I needed him, whenever I needed him, Dan was there _ ready and willing to make the tough choices, to cast the tough votes, to transform President Reagans vision of America into the law of the land.
