Naval officers familiar with the Iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked, or from a shell that cooks off _ ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round.
The job began just before midnight Wednesday, when officials in Norfolk received the list of the dead.
Wednesdays explosion brought the worst loss of life for the Navy since a 1977 accident off Spain, in which 49 sailors died when a launch returning them to the USS Guam and the USS Trenton was struck by a Spanish freighter.
