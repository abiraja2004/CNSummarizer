Omar said Tuesdays family gathering will be an occasion with a strong theme of sadness because after the reunion they will leave Mr. Mandela to resume his lonely life.
She said the family normally spent Mandelas birthday at home, fasting and praying, but members would visit him this year on his birthday because he has invited us to come and share it with him.
Evelyn Ntoko Mase, the cousin of ANC leader Walter Sisulu who has been imprisoned with Mandela, married Nelson Mandela in 1944.
One of their daughters, Makaziwe Mandela-Amuah, arrived with her three children from the United States, where she is studying for a doctoral degree in anthropology at Amherst College in Massachusetts.
