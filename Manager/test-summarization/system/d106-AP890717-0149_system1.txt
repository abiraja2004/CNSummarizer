Mandla is the son of Makgatho Mandela, the prisoners eldest son by his first marriage to Evelyn Ntoko Mase, who lives in the black township of Soweto and was not expected to join the reunion.
His wife, Winnie Mandela, arrived Monday night and indicated she did not expect Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, would be freed soon.
Omar said Tuesdays family gathering will be an occasion with a strong theme of sadness because after the reunion they will leave Mr. Mandela to resume his lonely life.
The largest family group to visit black leader Nelson Mandela since he was jailed 27 years ago gathered in Cape Town for a meeting Tuesday with the prisoner on his 71st birthday.
