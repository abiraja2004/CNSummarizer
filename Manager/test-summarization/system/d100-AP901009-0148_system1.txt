Official newspapers, which once denounced the Beatles as harmful pests from the decadent West, joined a worldwide celebration and ran stories of tribute about the late John Lennon, who would have turned 50 on Tuesday.
A plaque outside the hall reminded Beatles fans that Lennons near namesake, Vladimir Lenin, the founder of the Soviet state, had spoken at the spot in 1917 and 1919.
An anchorman, more accustomed to reading official government news, reported on the worldwide Lennon birthday bash and called his song Imagine, an anthem of peace.
Even the staid state television program Vremya got into act.
Andrei Trushkin, a correspondent for Komsomolskaya Pravda - the Communist Party youth newspaper that devoted a full page Tuesday to Lennon - said he appeals to Soviet youth in part because he was a rebel, like many of them, and was a difficult teen-ager.
