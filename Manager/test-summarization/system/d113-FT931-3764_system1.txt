One of the targets was close to the headquarters of Shiv Sena, a Hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots, in which most victims were Moslems.
The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time.
The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the citys better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor.
Some victims were crushed in the stampede to escape.
The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe setback to Indias attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
