At the 28-storey stock exchange building, about 3,000 people were on the second-storey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park, hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street.
The identity of the bombers was unknown, but the attacks were a severe setback to Indias attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
The Indian High Commission in London said the attacks were part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted India for some time.
The bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the citys better-off business people - in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor.
