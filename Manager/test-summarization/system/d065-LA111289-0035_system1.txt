That joke was not only funny, but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon: Americans didnt give a damn about the vice presidency (Mike Dukakis tried to make Quayle a major issue and failed), but some also felt that Quayle wasnt qualified for a job that had no qualifications.
So when Quayle got to Washington, he got there with one goal: Support the President and make himself a very small target.
And now was the time for Quayle to go on Meet the Press and show everybody just how right George Bush had been.
And Bushs announcement that Quayle would be his running mate again was Bushs way of saying: I didnt screw up the first time.
