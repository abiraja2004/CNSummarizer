Those who have known the Quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life.
I dont think it will be tough on the family, said Martha Saddler, Quayles sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind.
One of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit, said Indianapolis attorney William R. Neale, treasurer of Quayles 1986 re-election campaign.
Neale, who grew up with Marilyn Tucker Quayle in Indianapolis, introduced Dan Quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the Indiana University law school in the early 1970s.
