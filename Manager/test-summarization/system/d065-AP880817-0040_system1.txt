I dont think it will be tough on the family, said Martha Saddler, Quayles sister, who lives in Huntington, Ind.
His family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to, said Mitch Daniels, former political chief in the White House and now president of the Hudson Institute.
In an interview with Indiana reporters Monday, the Quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the familys loss of privacy during a national campaign.
Since hes been in politics, we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic schedule and wonder how he does it.
Quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if Bush offered it.
