Katihar Police Inspector N. Kumar said about 2,000 relatives and residents were waiting along the rain-swollen river for the bodies to be recovered.
Navy divers attempted to reach the submerged boat today, but the river was too muddy and its current too swift, said H.S.
The boat trip is normally used by Hindu pilgrims going across the river to worship at a shrine of Lord Shiva in Deoghar town.
Overcrowding and safety violations caused an aging ferry to capsize in the Ganges River, killing as many as 400 people, a government report said.
One survivor, Chadrasekhar D. Tiwary, said he was standing on the ferrys upper deck when it started wavering.
