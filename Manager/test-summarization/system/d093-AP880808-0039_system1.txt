He said he was waiting for the bodies so he could cremate them according to Hindu rites.
The ferry accident was said to be Indias worst ever.
Only about a dozen bodies have been found, and most of the missing were believed trapped inside the 35-year-old ferry.
Survivors said they protested when 150 bags of wheat were loaded onto the ferry.
He said the death toll may never be known because some bodies probably were carried downstream 30 to 60 miles by the surging water.
