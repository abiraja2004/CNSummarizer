As the western German population is now aware, German reunification needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern Germans living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank would wish.
It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is threatening the EMU commitment.
But Germany is the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, could afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.
