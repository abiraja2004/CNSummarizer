It is ironic that, just when German reunification presented a short-term reason for Germany to shift its anti-inflationary economic and monetary priorities, accommodating European convergence, Bundesbank intransigence is threatening the EMU commitment.
The governments of Europe have been remarkably patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of European effort for greater economic and political integration.
But Germany is the one economy which, for reasons of reunification, could afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front.
The European currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of Bundesbank interest rate policies.
A future European-wide central bank must clearly - like the US Federal Reserve - be more accountable in the broader European political and economic interest.
