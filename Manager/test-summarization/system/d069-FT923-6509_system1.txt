Sir, The argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free of party political interference, not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national, regional or global interests.
As the western German population is now aware, German reunification needs a strong, growing west German economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern Germans living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east - even if at the cost of higher German inflation than the Bundesbank would wish.
The governments of Europe have been remarkably patient with the Bundesbank, although it is threatening nearly 10 years of European effort for greater economic and political integration.
