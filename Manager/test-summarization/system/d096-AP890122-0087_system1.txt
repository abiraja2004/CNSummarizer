The winning score came at the end of a 92-yard drive, engineered by Montana, whose touchdown pass gave him a Super Bowl record with 357 yards passing.
The victory was achieved through the brilliance of Montana and Jerry Rice, the wide receiver who caught 12 passes for 222 yards, both Super Bowl records.
It was the fifth straight win for a National Football Conference team, but by far the most dramatic _ the previous four had been by an average score of 41-14.
Joe Montanas 10-yard touchdown pass to John Taylor with 34 seconds left provided the winning margin.
The game, before a crowd of 75,179 at Joe Robbie Stadium, went undisrupted by racial tensions in Miami.
