The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.
In the study, 421 people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery, while a comparison group of 417 people were treated with diet alone.
The $52 million, 17-year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks.
Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
Although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks, Buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question.
