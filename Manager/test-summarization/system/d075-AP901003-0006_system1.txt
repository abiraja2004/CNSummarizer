The approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage.
The surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries.
The overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another non-fatal heart attack was reduced 35 percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts.
Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
It has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack, Buchwald said.
