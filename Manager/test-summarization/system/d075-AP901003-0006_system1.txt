Besides diarrhea, those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones, gallstones and intestinal obstructions.
Dr. Henry Buchwald of the University of Minnesota, who directed the study, said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterol-lowering drugs as a possible standard treatment.
It has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack, Buchwald said.
The surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries.
The surgery, called a partial ileal bypass, has one significant drawback: It causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years.
