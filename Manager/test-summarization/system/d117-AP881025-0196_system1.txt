Panel chairman Michael Foot, a writer and former leader of the opposition Labor Party, said the judges agreed that entries this year had been exceptionally strong and that choosing the last six novels was extremely difficult.
Carey was an advertising copywriter before turning to writing books in 1965.
He was unsuccessful in the prize competition in 1985 when his novel, Illywhacker, was among the final six.
Carey, who lives in Sydney with his wife and son, said in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won.
