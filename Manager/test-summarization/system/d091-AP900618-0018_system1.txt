The number missing dropped to 16 with the other two bodies and the removal of two other names: a woman who called to say she was safe and a person who authorities werent sure lived in the area, said coroners investigator Chuck Vogt.
Another body was found in debris along Wegee Creek, and two bodies were found earlier in the Ohio, he said.
The debris broke loose, and thats when we got three big gushes of water, he said.
You cant swim out there that long in the Ohio River.
The death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern Ohio rose to 20 Sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the Ohio River.
