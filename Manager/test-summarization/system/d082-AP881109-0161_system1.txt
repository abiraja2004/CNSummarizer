Tass made no mention of Sakharov in its three-paragragh report, but said the Soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
That report from Radio Moscow, carried on its international-service news programs Tuesday, apparently was the only mention made by Soviet media of Sakharovs visit to the United States, which began Sunday.
Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled to spend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States, undergoing medical tests and promoting a new international organization he belongs to.
A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the Kremlins military drive into Afghanistan.
