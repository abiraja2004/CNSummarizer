Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled to spend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States, undergoing medical tests and promoting a new international organization he belongs to.
The official Tass news agency reported Wednesday that the organization Sakharov belongs to _ the International Foundation for the Survival and Development of Humanity _ held its first session in Boston the previous day.
The visit by human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. Star Wars program.
A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the Kremlins military drive into Afghanistan.
