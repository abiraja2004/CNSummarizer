Tass made no mention of Sakharov in its three-paragragh report, but said the Soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by Yevgeny Velikhov, vice president of the Soviet Academy of Sciences.
The visit by human rights activist Andrei D. Sakharov to the United States has gone virtually unreported by state media, with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the U.S. Star Wars program.
Sakharov, winner of the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize, is scheduled to spend two weeks visiting relatives in the United States, undergoing medical tests and promoting a new international organization he belongs to.
A celebrity in the West since he helped form the Soviet dissident movement of the 1970s, Sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the Kremlins military drive into Afghanistan.
