Dean Kelley, the National Council of Churches counselor on religious liberty, wrote a critique of Clarence Thomas that was used as grounds for his organizations opposition to the Supreme Court nominee.
; Clarence Thomas advocates a colorblind society, and his marriage may be an example of that philosophy.
; Virginia Thomas has represented the conservative viewpoint in her jobs as a staffer for a Republican congressman, spokeswoman at the U.S. Chamber of Congress and deputy assistant secretary at the Department of Labor.
The fact that she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence that Clarence Thomas has rejected his roots.
