A doctor from the Fuxing Hospital in western Beijing, where troops began firing on street people, said the hospital had taken in 15 dead and so many wounded they had to be put in garages.
An official loudspeaker on the square announced that the troops were moving in to clear the area as soldiers prepared to advance from all four sides.
Sporadic gunfire could still be heard on the outskirts of the square as troops shot at crowds of thousands.
The standoff between troops and protesters had been tense but largely peaceful for weeks, with soldiers seemingly reluctant or unable to move against the crowds until the first widespread violence broke out Saturday afternoon.
