Most of those shot on the square were hurling rocks at the troops and people close to their front lines.
By 3:30 a.m., soldiers and riot police had surrounded Tiananmen, boxing off several thousand students and supporters concentrated around a monument to revolutionary heroes in the center.
The standoff between troops and protesters had been tense but largely peaceful for weeks, with soldiers seemingly reluctant or unable to move against the crowds until the first widespread violence broke out Saturday afternoon.
A Swedish visitor, Tom Hansson, said he saw three people shot to death in clashes south of the square.
A government loudspeaker on the square charged the students with counterrevolutionary turmoil and said the military was taking necessary means to end their rebellion.
