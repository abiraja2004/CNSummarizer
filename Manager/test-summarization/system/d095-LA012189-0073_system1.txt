Watching News Ly said he was watching a news report about the massacre Tuesday morning in which five children and the gunman were killed when he spotted the picture of a 9-year-old victim he recognized as his lost son.
Ly, who had been a captain in the Cambodian army, said that he became separated from Or, then three months pregnant with Rathanan, when the country was occupied by Khmer Rouge guerrillas.
Kim Ly, 40, a Cambodian refugee from Ohio who recognized his sons face among televised pictures of children slain in the mass shooting spree, met for the first time since 1979 with family members grieving for his son.
