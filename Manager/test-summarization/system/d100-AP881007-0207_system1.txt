Imagine theres no countries It isnt hard to do Nothing to kill or die for And no religion too Imagine all the people Living life in peace ... You may say im a dreamer But im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world be as one.
I was also surprised that so many people stood up against it (the Goldman book).
Imagine theres no heaven Its easy if you try No hell below us Above us only sky Imagine all the people Living for today.
The only reason why I did watch it to the end is because Im responsible for it, even though somebody else made it, she said.
