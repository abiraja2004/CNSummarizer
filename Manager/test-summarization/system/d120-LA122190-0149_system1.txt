Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis.
If he stays in Kuwait, in a country which essentially at the moment is rather like a prison camp, a country that hes dismantling day after day, then he will have to be forcibly removed, Major said.
Consistent with the U.S. view on the gulf, Major said: There is nothing whatsoever to negotiate about.
A complete withdrawal is necessary, a partial withdrawal wont do, Major said in a display of solidarity with U.S. policy on the Persian Gulf.
