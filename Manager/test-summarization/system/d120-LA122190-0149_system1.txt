Major, just as unyielding in talking about Hussein as was his predecessor, Margaret Thatcher, rejected the notion that a partial Iraqi pullback from Kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis.
If he stays in Kuwait, in a country which essentially at the moment is rather like a prison camp, a country that hes dismantling day after day, then he will have to be forcibly removed, Major said.
Consistent with the U.S. view on the gulf, Major said: There is nothing whatsoever to negotiate about.
At the same time, Major demonstrated the kinder, gentler face he has brought to British politics since his accession, showing none of the abrasiveness that was a Thatcher hallmark.
