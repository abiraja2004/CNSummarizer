About #210 million will be used to pay back bank loans and the rest to pay in full a loan from Robert Maxwell Holdings Ltd. Salomon Bros. International is underwriting the international part of the offering, covering approximately one-third of the shares on sale, to be privately placed with institutional investors in the U.S., Canada and Europe.
Mirrors flagship publication is the tabloid Daily Mirror, with sales of three million copies daily.
Through staff cuts and heavy spending on printing facilities, Mr. Maxwell built Mirror into one of Britains most profitable newspaper groups.
