Gratz, 59, is the second senior Socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the so-called Lucona scandal, the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee.
Proksch, wanted by Austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud, has been variously described to be living in Syria, the Philippines and Latin America.
My decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated, Gratz told the house.
In past newspaper stories, Gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help Proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant.
