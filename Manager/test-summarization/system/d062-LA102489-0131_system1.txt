The governor is wrong, however, in his campaign to distance himself from the California Department of Transportation on the issue of what caused the Nimitz Freeway in Oakland to collapse, and what could or should have been done to have prevented it.
The governor complained on Sunday that the highway engineers never came to him and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake.
The governor and Legislature should not wait too long to start the session, although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to California.
