Although the damage from the hurricanes landfall in Florida on Monday was much greater than initially esti mated, insurers losses there are likely to total less than Dollars 1bn, well below earlier expectations, a senior member of Lloyds insurance market said yesterday.
HURRICANE Andrew, claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in US history, yesterday smashed its way through the state of Louisiana, inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the low-lying city of New Orleans.
Hurricane Hugo, which devastated much of South Carolina in 1989, cost the insurance industry some Dollars 4.2bn.
The Lloyds member, in close contact with leading insurers in Florida, said that damage to insured property was remarkably small.
