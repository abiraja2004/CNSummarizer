The earthquake that struck northern Iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated Soviet Armenia in 1988.
Twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude 7 have occurred in Iran during the last 30 years, Needham said.
In the Armenian quake, a Soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings.
The 7.7-magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area, where two major plates of the earths crust meet, he said.
Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you, said Needham in a telephone interview from Golden, Colo.
Like Thursdays earthquake in Iran, the Dec. 7, 1988, earthquake in Armenia killed about 25,000 people.
