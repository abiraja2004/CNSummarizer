Jamaican Prime Minister Edward Seaga said late Tuesday that at least six people were killed, and an estimated 60,000 were left homeless in the worst natural disaster in the modern history of Jamaica.
The hurricane, one of the strongest in history, is extremely dangerous, the U.S. National Weather Service said.
The National Weather Service in Miami said the eye of the storm was over northeast Yucatan at noon EDT.
The hurricane center said Gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure.
Only two Category 5 hurricanes have hit the United States _ the 1935 storm that killed 408 people in Florida and Hurricane Camille that devastated the Mississippi coast in 1969 and killed 256 people.
