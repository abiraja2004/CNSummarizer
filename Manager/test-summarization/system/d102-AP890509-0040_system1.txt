Broadcaster Diane Sawyer told the crowd that the death of Miss Ball may have settled a longstanding theological debate over whether there is laughter in heaven.
Thousands of Lucille Balls fans shed tears for the woman who made them laugh, as three cities held memorial services in which the redheaded comedian was remembered with prayers and applause.
Miss Ball, known for her honed comedic timing, wide-mouthed expressions and wacky antics, was popular among generations of fans who watched I Love Lucy as a first-run show in the 50s and in three decades of reruns.
In announcing the services, Miss Balls family said: Monday night was the time when most of the nation was used to being with Lucy.
