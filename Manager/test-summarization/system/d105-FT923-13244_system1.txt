The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either Russian or Georgian authorities.
RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed blue helmet troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow.
But Itar-Tass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians and injured two others, underscoring the difficulties facing the operation.
The mission was the first peace-keeping attempt anywhere in the former Soviet Union, whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the Romanian to the Afghan borders.
