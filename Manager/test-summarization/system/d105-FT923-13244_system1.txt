RUSSIA and Georgia yesterday deployed blue helmet troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of South Ossetia in the first peace-keeping operation since the collapse of the Soviet Union, Reuter reports from Moscow.
The greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides, operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either Russian or Georgian authorities.
Reports from the remote Transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed Russian troops from the 104th paratroop battalion moved into a 7km-wide security zone separating rebel South Ossetia from the rest of Georgia.
Russia and Georgia were cautiously optimistic that Ossetia could be the first region of the former Soviet Union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of political measures and actions.
