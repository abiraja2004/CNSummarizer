The republics parliament acted in response to a decree issued on Dec. 22 by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the official news agency Tass reported.
The Moldavian legislature has also voted to declare the elections null and void.
Soviet hard-liners want Gorbachev to impose a state of emergency and presidential rule in troubled zones throughout the ethnically and geographically diverse country.
After residents of the Gagauz region began holding local elections in late October, the Moldavian legislature clamped a two-month state of emergency on the region, restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rallies.
Gorbachev said the conflicts had reached critical levels, and he put part of the blame on the Moldavian Supreme Soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities.
