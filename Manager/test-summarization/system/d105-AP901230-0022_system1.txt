Tass said the Moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that Gorbachev said restricted the rights of minorities.
Gorbachev said the declaration of the Gagauz and Dniester republics was illegal under the Soviet and Moldavian constitutions, as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies.
The unrest turned violent last month, when government troops clashed with activists, leaving four dead.
Gorbachev said the conflicts had reached critical levels, and he put part of the blame on the Moldavian Supreme Soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities.
After residents of the Gagauz region began holding local elections in late October, the Moldavian legislature clamped a two-month state of emergency on the region, restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rallies.
