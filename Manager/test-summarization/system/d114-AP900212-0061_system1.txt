Srinagar, the summer capital of Jammu-Kashmir, has been the center of the secessionist movement that has turned violent in recent years.
Five were in critical condition in a hospital in Muzzafarabad, the capital of Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, he said, adding he knew of only one death.
Most of them were subsequently released, but the arrests sparked widespread violence.
A spokesman for the Indian Defense Ministry said Pakistani troops then fired about 200 rounds from light and medium weapons at Indian border posts in the Uri sector.
Most of the victims have been curfew-breaking protesters shot by security forces in Srinagar.
A Pakistani spokesman, who also refused to be identified, said Pakistani army patrols repulsed a mob of some 1,200 demonstrators.
