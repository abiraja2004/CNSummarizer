After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his novel The Satanic Verses blasphemed their faith.
Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his novel An Artist of the Floating World.
Now that circumstances have changed, when perhaps it is inconvenient for many people to support his writing, I just felt it was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him, Ishiguro said.
In announcing the winner, the judges said: The Remains of the Day renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and explores the large, vexed themes of class, tradition and duty.
