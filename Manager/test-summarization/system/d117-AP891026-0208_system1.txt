After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his novel The Satanic Verses blasphemed their faith.
Other finalists this year were Canadian Margaret Atwood for Cats Eye, Irish author John Banville for Book of Evidence, Scotlands James Kelman for A Disaffection and English writers Sybille Bedford for Jigsaw and Rose Tremain for Restoration.
Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his novel An Artist of the Floating World.
In announcing the winner, the judges said: The Remains of the Day renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and explores the large, vexed themes of class, tradition and duty.
