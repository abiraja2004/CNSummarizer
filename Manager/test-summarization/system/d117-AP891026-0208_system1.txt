Ishiguro was a finalist for the Booker Prize in 1986 for his novel An Artist of the Floating World.
After receiving the prize, Ishiguro paid tribute to Salman Rushdie, the 1988 runner-up for the award, who went into hiding in February when he was threatened with death by Moslems who said his novel The Satanic Verses blasphemed their faith.
The Booker Prize is sponsored by Booker, an international food and agriculture business.

The prize is worth $32,000.
