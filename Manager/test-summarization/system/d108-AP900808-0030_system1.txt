On Tuesday, countries ranging from powerful Japan to neutral Switzerland to tiny Cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort to convince the Baghdad government to withdraw its troops that invaded Kuwait on Thursday.
Hitting Baghdad where it hurts, more countries have joined a U.N.-sanctioned boycott of oil from Iraq and Kuwait.
France will introduce controls Thursday on prices of petroleum products to prevent refiners from using Iraqs invasion of Kuwait as an excuse to raise prices, acting Premier Pierre Beregovoy announced Tuesday.
China joined the U.N. decision to embargo arms sales to Iraq, but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning the invasion.
