Turkey announced it was shut down the twin Iraqi oil pipelines that run through it to the Mediterranean _ carrying half of Baghdads crude output _ and cutting off trade with Iraq.
Cyprus sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up 70 percent of its oil imports, government spokesman Akis Fantis said.
Cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of August, he said, but we are already in the process of taking steps to secure alternative sources ... The worldwide closing of ranks against Iraqi oil imports is likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices, which have already risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact on the world economy.
