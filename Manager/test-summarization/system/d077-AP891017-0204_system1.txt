It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area, Allen said.
The high probability is based on several factors, including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in 1906, said Clarence Allen, professor of Geology and Geophysics at the California Institue of Technology in Pasadena.
The highest, the USGS says, is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
He noted that the 1988 report, titled Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault, presented information that was already widely known among scientists.
