It just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area, Allen said.
Its not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a calamitous event.
He noted that the 1988 report, titled Probabilities of Large Earthquakes Occurring in California on the San Andreas Fault, presented information that was already widely known among scientists.
The highest, the USGS says, is in the central California town of Parkfield, where there is a 90 percent probability of a magnitude 6 earthquake by the year 2018.
Allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in San Francisco also exist in the Los Angeles region.
