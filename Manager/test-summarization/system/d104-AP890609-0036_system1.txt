The army on Thursday allowed the people of Beijing their first glance of the 100-acre expanse since the military swept into the capital six days ago, leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement for political change.
Chinese Red Cross officials estimate 3,600 people were killed and 60,000 injured over the weekend, citing a Chinese students organization, the Union of Chinese Students in West Germany.
From this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant mass of demonstrators enveloped 5,000 troops and blocked their entry to the square.
On the southern perimeter, a single line of tanks and a cordon of soldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists who pedaled slowly by, peering into Tiananmen.
