The National Weather Service earlier said a tornado hit the east Alabama hamlet of Mellow Valley, severely damaging at least one home and causing some injuries.
Mayor Steve Hettinger said 14 deaths had been confirmed, with 285 people injured and about 500 displaced by the tornado that struck while city streets were filled with rush-hour traffic.
He said two people were killed when the twister hit house trailers in rural areas east of Huntsville.
In Georgia, five people were injured, four critically, after a tornado struck two mobile home parks and an interstate highway near Palmetto.
Another tornado touched down about 1:30 p.m. as severe weather swept across much of Alabama and the National Weather Service placed most of the state under a tornado watch.
