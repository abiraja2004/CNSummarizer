Marcos mother, Josefa, died a year ago, but because Marcos has been barred from this country, the family refuses to have her remains interred.
President Corazon Aquino said Friday that for security reasons she would not permit deposed President Ferdinand E. Marcos to be buried in the Philippines.
Marcos has been excused from appearing in court up to now because of his failing health.
I regret to inform Mrs. Marcos that as much as I agree that Mr. Marcos has his rights, I still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of Filipinos, Aquino told reporters at the presidential palace.
