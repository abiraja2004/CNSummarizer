There is very serious flooding in the Cayman Islands, Erina Nichols, a tourism official in Miami, said Tuesday after speaking with residents of the islands.
Warren Chase, an amateur radio operator in Fort Myers, Fla., said he received a report of sailboat with seven people aboard missing near the Cayman Islands.
They gave no figures on the numer of evacuees, but said people in Cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center, about 6 miles away.
The storm later knocked out all telephone service to the Cayman Islands, a British dependency of 23,000 people that was expecting 12-foot tides.
