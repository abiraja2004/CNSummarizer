Further explanation of the first polyp removal would have to come from Towers surgeon, who was unavailable for comment Thursday night, the spokesman said.
A preliminary biopsy of the polyp showed it was benign, Habgood said, but further results would be announced Friday by Towers surgeon, Dr. R.D.
After leaving the Senate in 1985, Tower went into business as a defense consultant.
When Tower underwent the colonscopy examination, a rectal polyp also was discovered and removed.
Tower, 63, a U.S. senator from Texas for 24 years, was admitted to Baylor University Medical Center on Wednesday after undergoing a colonscopy examination last week that revealed the polyp, Habgood said.
