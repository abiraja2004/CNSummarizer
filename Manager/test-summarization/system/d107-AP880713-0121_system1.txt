Everything looks so good with a bit of rain over the past 24 hours, farmer Herman Krone said Tuesday at his 2,800-acre farm in southern Illinois, which President Reagan plans to visit Thursday during a tour of the drought-stricken area.
Heavy rain deluged some drought-hit areas as Congress began working on a package of relief for Americas farmers, and farmers in Kentucky today greeted the arrival of the first shipment of hay airlifted free from Oregon.
The drought has had a silver lining for anglers in the Reno, Nevada, area.
Wallace Wilkinson and business manager of the familys farm, was at Louisvilles Standiford Field today for the arrival of the first hay shipment from Portland, Ore. United Parcel Service plans to ship free of charge 20 to 30 tons of hay from Portland to Louisville each day for the next two weeks.
