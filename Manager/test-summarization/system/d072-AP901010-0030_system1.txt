Bernstein was the wunderkind of American music at a time when all respected conductors in the United States were born and trained in Europe.
Bernsteins announcement was met with dismay in the music world, especially at the New York Philharmonic, which he directed from 1958 to 1969.
In 1969, he retired from the post to concentrate on composing and was appointed the Philharmonics laureate conductor for life.
His first published composition was The Clarinet Sonata in 1942.
After Boston Symphony Orchestra conductor Serge Koussevitzky died in 1951, Bernstein became head of the orchestra and conducting departments at Tanglewood.
He last conducted Aug. 19 at the Tanglewood Music Center in western Massachusetts.
