Conductor Leonard Bernstein, the West Side Story composer who mesmerized audiences with his passion and physical flair at the podium, is giving up the baton because of poor health.
Bernstein, known for his vigorous style at the podium, once led an orchestra performance at a liberated concentration camp.
In 1969, he retired from the post to concentrate on composing and was appointed the Philharmonics laureate conductor for life.
The 72-year-old maestro suffers from a lung tumor, emphysema and pulmonary infections and has been told by his doctor to stop conducting and performing on the piano, his spokeswoman said Tuesday.
She said Bernstein plans to continue work on a new chamber music piece to be performed next spring, a new musical theater work he hopes to finish by summer and several educational, film and recording projects, as well as his memoirs.
