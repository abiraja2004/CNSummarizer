The spokesman said Thatcher asked Gorbachev about a report from Washington that Moscow sold up to 15 long-range fighter-bombers to Libya, which Britain accuses of sponsoring terrorism.
He said Thatcher also accused the Soviets of having been not as frank as they should be about their chemical weapons arsenal.
Gorbachev also hit the streets of London, stopping his motorcade to shake hands with about 20 people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside Westminster Abbey.
Emerging from her 10 Downing St. residence into the icy rain with Gorbachev at her side, Thatcher told reporters: The talks have been very deep, very wide ranging and very friendly, and as always we got to grips with the real issues.
