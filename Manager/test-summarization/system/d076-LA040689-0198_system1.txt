He said Thatcher also accused the Soviets of having been not as frank as they should be about their chemical weapons arsenal.
Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher today argued passionately during a four-hour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of Soviet bomber sales to Libya, officials said.
The spokesman said Thatcher asked Gorbachev about a report from Washington that Moscow sold up to 15 long-range fighter-bombers to Libya, which Britain accuses of sponsoring terrorism.
Although the two leaders could make no progress on the bomber issue, the spokesman said the Soviet and British foreign ministers, meeting separately, would most likely discuss the matter at length.
