Super Bowl XXIV (CBS): 39.0 2.
Super Bowl Postgame (CBS): 25.3 3.
It also is only the second time the Super Bowl network was third for the week -- dating back to NBC in 1979.
The big winner was the American Music Awards on ABC, which came in 10th for the week.
Super Bowl XXIV was the most watched television event of the week, viewed by a whopping 63% of TV viewers, but not even Joe Montana could lift CBS out of the cellar in the ratings race, it was reported today.
The Wonder Years (ABC): 20.4 10.
This also marks only the third time that the network airing the Super Bowl did not win the week -- NBC managed it in 1979 and 1981.
