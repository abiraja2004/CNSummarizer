Rabbi Abraham Weiss of the Hebrew Institute announced his Coalition of Concern will hold a protest at Mandelas public welcome in New York because of the anti-apartheid leaders unbending anti-Israel stance.
Mayor David Dinkins warned Jewish groups against protesting the visit of anti-apartheid leader Nelson Mandela to New York City, saying the protests might insult the black community, a newspaper said today.
Mandela has embraced Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in public and has compared the struggle of Palestinians to that of black South Africans.
The mayor also asked members of the organized Jewish community to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the visit, the Daily News said.
