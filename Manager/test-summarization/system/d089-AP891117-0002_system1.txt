Ive never seen as much rubble from a tornado before, said Danny Cooper, the state agencys director.
Hunt asked that flags around the state be lowered to half-staff through Tuesday in memory of the victims, and Marilyn Quayle, wife of the vice president, planned to visit the battered city Saturday.
Police spokesman Ronnie Fudge said several truckloads of food had arrived but the city is running out of places to store the goods.
Because the tornado struck at 4:30 p.m., most of the classrooms were empty and only six children were injured.
State emergency management officials estimated the damage in excess of $100 million in the agencys letter to President Bush requesting a disaster declaration, said Terry Abbott, the governors press secretary.
