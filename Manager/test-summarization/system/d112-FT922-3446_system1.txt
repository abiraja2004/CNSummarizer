The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell, said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs by Bishopsgate Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41 Lothbury.
In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be sent by Goldman back to BIT.
This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the Maxwell family.
The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares.
