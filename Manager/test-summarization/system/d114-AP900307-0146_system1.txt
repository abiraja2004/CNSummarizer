An around-the-clock curfew was imposed Friday after security forces the day before shot and killed 49 Moslem demonstrators marching into Srinagar to take part in a pro-independence rally.
At least 1 million Moslems demonstrated to demand independence for the predominantly Moslem state; India is predominantly Hindu.
Moslems blew up a truck carrying security forces Wednesday, killing three soldiers in the few hours the government relaxed a curfew designed to stop the Kashmiri separatist uprising, officials said.
The curfew was relaxed from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. to allow people in the city of 1 million to shop for food and other essentials.
