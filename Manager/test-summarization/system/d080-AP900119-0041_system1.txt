Robert Philibosian, now in private practice, angrily dismissed accusations that he played up the McMartin case in 1984 _ with the news media acting as eager accomplices _ to boost his public profile as he ran for district attorney.

Life is not fair, said Robert Curry, whose son attended the McMartin school.
