The system is not going to protect children, said Jackie McGauley, a parent who believes her child had been molested but didnt testify in the case.
There was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic McMartin Pre-School molestation trial, but no one was willing to accept it.
But Reiner, calling his dismissal of charges for lack of evidence the decision were proud of, said the trial took so long because of the states ponderous criminal justice system, delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by Philibosian.
Philibosian said Reiner hurt prosecutors chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a 1986 60 Minutes interview.
