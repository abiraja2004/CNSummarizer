While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart attack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed.
Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims are considered to be candidates for the drugs.
Dr. Thomas J. Ryan of Boston University Medical Center commented, We have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery.
To be effective, the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms.
The study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clot-dissolving drugs, they usually dont need the extra step of the common balloon procedure, known as angioplasty.
