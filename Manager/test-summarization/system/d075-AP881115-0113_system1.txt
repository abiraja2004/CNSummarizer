At 50 hospitals across the United States, doctors randomly assigned 1,636 patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit.
Experts say that only about 20 percent of heart attack victims are considered to be candidates for the drugs.
While small hospitals can give clot-dissolving drugs to heart attack patients, most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed.
Its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks, it could raise the nations annual medical bills by $704 million.
The latest study, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association, was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving TPA.
