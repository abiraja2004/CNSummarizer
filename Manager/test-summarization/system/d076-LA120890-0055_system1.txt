Palace insiders said Friday that one reason for the quick award of the Order of Merit, restricted to only 24 eminent men and women, was the queens desire to demonstrate that there is no animosity between Britains two most prominent women.
This puts (to rest) rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didnt like each other, said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burkes Peerage and an authority on the royal family.
Queen Elizabeth II awarded former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the coveted Order of Merit on Friday and made her husband a baronet, which is a hereditary knighthood.
I have done pretty well out of being Mrs. Thatcher, said the former prime minister, who resigned Nov. 22 during a fight for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
