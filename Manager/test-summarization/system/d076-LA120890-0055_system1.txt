I have done pretty well out of being Mrs. Thatcher, said the former prime minister, who resigned Nov. 22 during a fight for the leadership of the Conservative Party.
This puts (to rest) rumors that the queen and Mrs. Thatcher didnt like each other, said Harold Brooks-Baker, director of Burkes Peerage and an authority on the royal family.
With an OM, Thatcher can continue to serve in the House of Commons as the member from the North London constituency of Finchley.
As a member of the Order of Merit, created in 1902, Thatcher joins such luminaries in the world of arts, science and politics as philosopher Isiah Berlin, historian Veronica Wedgwood, writer Graham Greene, violinist Yehudi Menuhin and artist Sidney Noland, as well as honorary member Mother Teresa.
