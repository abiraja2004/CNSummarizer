Within half an hour, the Islamic Republic News Agency reported that the tremor had been felt in Tehran, the capital.
The only detail reported for hours was that, when the quake hit, Tehran residents were either asleep or watching a World Cup soccer match between Brazil and Scotland.
Official radio was off the air when the earthquake struck, and although it came back on the air to report important news during the Iran-Iraq War, there was no such move Thursday.
Iranian radio first reported the earthquake on the main newscast 6 1/2 hours later.
But subsequent reports, some a few minutes apart, said the damage must have been principally to crops, with brief mentions that many casualties were feared in Zanjan and Gilan provinces.
