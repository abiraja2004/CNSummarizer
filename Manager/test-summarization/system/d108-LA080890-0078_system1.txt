Invading Iraqis have been permitted to take over the homes and even wear the clothes of Kuwaitis who have been killed or have fled their homeland, Kuwaits ambassador to the United States charged Tuesday.
That is because the fleeing Kuwaitis apparently are being replaced by Iraqis seeking to meld in with the local population, he contended.
They are giving them Kuwaiti clothes in order to make it appear that these are the people of Kuwait.
Kuwaiti officials who have been detained by the Iraqi military and who have refused to cooperate have been executed, Saud claimed, adding: We have eyewitness reports.
