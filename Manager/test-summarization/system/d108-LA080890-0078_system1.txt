Invading Iraqis have been permitted to take over the homes and even wear the clothes of Kuwaitis who have been killed or have fled their homeland, Kuwaits ambassador to the United States charged Tuesday.
Kuwaiti officials who have been detained by the Iraqi military and who have refused to cooperate have been executed, Saud claimed, adding: We have eyewitness reports.
They are giving them Kuwaiti clothes in order to make it appear that these are the people of Kuwait.
They are trucking them in, busing them in, trying to replace the population, to change the makeup of the place, Saud said, adding they were issuing the new residents cards that identify them as Kuwaiti citizens.
