San Francisco fire officials said as many as 60 buildings in the Marina District may have to be torn down because of structural instability caused by the earthquake.
Earthquake experts said they were not surprised that the high-rises swayed with the earthquake while four-story buildings collapsed.
What collapsed and killed some people were four-story apartment buildings that had garages built all the way along the bottom (floor), Yanev said.
Why did high-rises that form the elegant San Francisco skyline escape virtually unscathed while an office building in the citys southeast district peel apart, killing five pedestrians below?
Chinatown survived relatively intact, Yanev said, because it is located up in the hills atop very firm soil, and the epicenter of the temblor was many miles away.
