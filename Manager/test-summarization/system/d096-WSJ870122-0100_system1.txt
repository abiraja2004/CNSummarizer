That will be a big job for Barron Hilton, chairman of Hilton Hotels Corp., who along with Alex Spanos, owner of the San Diego Chargers, is holding a pre-Super Bowl brunch Sunday at the Beverly Hilton Hotel for 1,800 guests including business leaders, entertainment personalities and customers.
Allen Hermansen, a Hilton senior vice president, says the bash is tax deductible because our sales people will be there and business will be discussed.
If a host wants to deduct 80% of the bill, he or she must talk business with all of the guests, Mr. Lipton says.
And if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game, the business gift carries a total deduction of only $25 for each recipient.
