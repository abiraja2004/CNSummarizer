Laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to President Corazon Aquinos forces, as she has demanded.
He called the group his partys junta, but said they have no ties to the rebels.
Philippine Vice President and opposition leader Salvador H. Laurel declined Saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels have the right to try to seize power.
Laurel said the coup occurred because Aquino failed to unite the nation or the armed forces, leading to divided loyalties and fragmentation.
U.S. officials have said F-4 Phantom jets flew over rebel aircraft to keep them grounded but did not drop bombs or fire.
