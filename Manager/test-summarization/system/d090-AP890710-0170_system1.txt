Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her homeland.
Weizsaecker said the Philippines have had good results in trade with West Germany, and assured Mrs. Aquino that the barrier-free market the European Economic Community plans for 1992 will not lock out trade with other countries.
We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor, she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade.
