We have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as Germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars, she said.
President Corazon Aquino of the Philippines on Monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation.
Mrs. Aquino, comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted Philippine economy to the recovery of West Germany after World War II, asked that Germany share its experience with her homeland.
We have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation, nor debt relief at the price of national honor, she said in a speech to the West German Chamber of Industry and Trade.
