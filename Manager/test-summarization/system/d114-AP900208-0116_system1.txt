Moslem militants armed with automatic rifles shot and killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on Thursday in Srinagar, the flashpoint of a violent separatist campaign, officials said.
The deaths brought to 81 the number of people killed since Jan. 20 in clashes between security forces and Moslem militants fighting for secession of the Moslem-dominated Kashmir region from Hindu-majority India.
Witnesses said a cigarette vendor also was killed in the attack, which occurred outside the vendors kiosk in the Chanpora suburb of the city.
A curfew that was to have begun at 6 p.m. instead took effect in the afternoon in three areas of the city after the shootings.
