Police said a drifter identified as Patrick Edward Purdy, 26, armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds before he shot himself to death.
Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their children.
I was scared, said sixth-grader Binh Hoang, who was born in Vietnam in 1975 in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire.
But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the scream of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank.
