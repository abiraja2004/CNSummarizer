He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders to prevent East Germans from escaping to West Germany when he served as the countrys leader.
Honecker, 78, was ousted as East Germanys leader on Oct. 18, paving the way for the countrys first freely elected government in March.
Bild quoted Guenter Seidel, an East German prosecutor, as saying that Honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for leaders of the former Communist government.
Bild said that Erich Mielke, the ex-head of East Germanys former secret police, was also unlikely to go to court in East Germany.
