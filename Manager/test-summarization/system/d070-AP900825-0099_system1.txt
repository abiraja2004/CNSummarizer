Bild quoted Guenter Seidel, an East German prosecutor, as saying that Honecker had used $42 million for stocking a private housing estate for leaders of the former Communist government.
However, Seidel said that the investigation was not far enough along to determine whether charges could be filed against Honecker before East Germany merges with West Germany on Oct. 3.
He is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power, corruption, harboring terrorists and issuing shoot-to-kill orders to prevent East Germans from escaping to West Germany when he served as the countrys leader.
The Hamburg-based Bild am Sonntag said Saturday that it would report in its Sunday editions that Honecker could be prosecuted in a united Germany, however, for violation of property laws.
