A partial collapse of the grand Longwangang embankment at the Xihu fishing ground in the Wangyuehu district of Changsha has put the lives and property of 60,000 people in danger.
By the early hours of this morning roads and surfaces of bridges in the Wangyuehu district had been inundated.
The city government of Changsha has asked residents within the endangered areas to relocate themselves and remove their property to safer places, in case of the occurrence of more serious flooding.
The flood has caused serious losses to people along both banks of the river, especially in Changsha, according to the sources.
