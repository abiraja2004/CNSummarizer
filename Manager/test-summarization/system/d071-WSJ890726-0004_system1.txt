The Remondis also say Mr. Attalla has bought a Rottweiler to show in another category and doesnt want to spend money on both Cory and the other dog.
The Remondis argue that the retirement fraudulently deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert is in the best condition of his life.
In the suit, he says that under the owners agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show -- or to retire -- Cory.
In return, he is entitled to all ribbons and awards.
In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News).
