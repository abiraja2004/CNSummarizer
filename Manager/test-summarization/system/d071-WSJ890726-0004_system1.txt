In what is fast becoming a pit-bull match, the one owner, Anthony Attalla, is suing the other two, John and Rita Remondi, charging that they have been showing Cory even though he is officially retired (as announced in Dog News).
So far, Mr. Attalla says, hes spent over $125,000, the amount sought in damages.
In a memo filed in court, Mr. Remondi claims that Mr. Attalla retired the dog simply and solely to better the chances that Mr. Attallas agent would win with a rival Rover.
The Remondis argue that the retirement fraudulently deprives them of their opportunity to show Cory, a dog who they assert is in the best condition of his life.
