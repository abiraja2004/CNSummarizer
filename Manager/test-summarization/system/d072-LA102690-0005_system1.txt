With a two-day pass in hand, I hitchhiked to Jerusalem, where the Israeli equivalent of the USO scrounged up a ticket for the evenings performance of the Israel Philharmonic, with Bernstein as the guest conductor.
What would have been a distracting disturbance at any other time, melded, with the music as entirely appropriate to the mood and circumstances of the occasion.
Mine dates back to October, 1948, when I was serving as an American volunteer in the Israeli army during the countrys War of Independence.
The audience was a mix of black-tie patrons and soldiers dressed in fatigues.
I assume that anyone who was ever touched by the genius of Leonard Bernstein will have his own memory of the Renaissance man of music, as you aptly described him (Part A, Oct. 15).
