With a two-day pass in hand, I hitchhiked to Jerusalem, where the Israeli equivalent of the USO scrounged up a ticket for the evenings performance of the Israel Philharmonic, with Bernstein as the guest conductor.
The audience was a mix of black-tie patrons and soldiers dressed in fatigues.
What would have been a distracting disturbance at any other time, melded, with the music as entirely appropriate to the mood and circumstances of the occasion.
Bernstein raised the baton for Beethovens Fifth Symphony, emotional at any time, but never more so than for a people engaged in a life-and-death struggle.
I assume that anyone who was ever touched by the genius of Leonard Bernstein will have his own memory of the Renaissance man of music, as you aptly described him (Part A, Oct. 15).
