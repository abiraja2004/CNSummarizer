Tanks moved into place on what had hours earlier been a rag-tag squatters camp of tents for the pro-democracy students.
The few thousand students remaining in the square stayed calm as they quietly gathered on the steps of the heroes monument.
They took up positions to the east after a brief skirmish involving clubs and sticks with students.
The government is corrupt, youve been tricked, the students roared.
Gunfire could be heard from several sides, and tracers zipped through the sky above Mao Tse-tungs mausoleum, one of the main monuments to Chinese communism in the square.
After the lights went back on a half hour later, a voice vote by the students showed most wanted to leave the square to avoid further bloodshed.
