Dawn broke Sunday over a battle-scarred Tiananmen Square with tanks and rifle-toting troops ruling the vast expanse occupied the day before by students seeking a freer society from their communist rulers.
The battle for Tiananmen was primarily fought in the streets leading to the square, where scores of people fell trying to prevent columns of troops and armored military vehicles from moving on the students.
Gunfire could be heard from several sides, and tracers zipped through the sky above Mao Tse-tungs mausoleum, one of the main monuments to Chinese communism in the square.
More soldiers were deployed in front of the Great Hall of the People to the west, and a huge convoy with armored vehicles rolled down Changan Avenue to the north side.
