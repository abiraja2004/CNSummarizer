Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job, Emmanuel said.
Information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the large-scale models that television viewers see every night.
We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products, Pyke said, and that its ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storms path.
Hurricane specialist Gil Clark, who has tracked hurricanes for 35 years, said that a couple of decades ago, the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships.
