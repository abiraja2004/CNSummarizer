We have to remember that those models used are only guidance products, Pyke said, and that its ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storms path.
Pinpointing the exact point of Hugos landfall was difficult, but forecasters said Friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation.
The real forecasting problem with Hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm, which was upgraded to a Category 4 hurricane just hours before it slammed into Charleston.
Most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane, and they do a very good job, Emmanuel said.
