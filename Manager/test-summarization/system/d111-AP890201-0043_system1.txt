The sinking of the 400-foot Bahia Paraiso followed warnings from the U.S. National Science Foundation that the unspoiled Antarctic could face ecological disaster if the 250,000 gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill.
Agency spokesman Jack Renerie said Tuesday before the ship sank that the leak, which was threatening penguins and other wildlife, had stopped.
Before the sinking, Argentine officials had discounted a spill.
An Argentine supply ship that ran aground off Antarctica sank Tuesday in heavy seas and high winds, the government said, and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment.
