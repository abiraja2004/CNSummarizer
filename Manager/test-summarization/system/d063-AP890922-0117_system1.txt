Chief Police Inspector Alan Butterfield of Kent, who who provided the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort, first reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was accounted for.
One of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade ground, said a ministry spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom.
Mrs. Minnocks next-door neighbor, Heather Hackett, said she was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of the explosion.
The last IRA bomb attempt on the British mainland was in February when about 60 soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in Shropshire, western England, just before a bomb exploded.
