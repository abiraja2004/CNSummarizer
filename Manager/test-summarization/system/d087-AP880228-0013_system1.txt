Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do it before Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
Debi Thomas dream of Olympic gold turned into disappointment Saturday as East Germanys Katarina Witt won her second straight Olympic championship and Canadian Elizabeth Manley took home the silver before a crowd of cheering countrymen.
Back to school, said Thomas, who won the bronze medal despite three faulty landings.
While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to music from Bizets Carmen, Manley was so sensational in the freestyle that she finished first with seven judges.
Witt, a three-time world champion from East Germany, became the first repeat singles champion since Dick Button took Olympic gold in 1948 and 52.
