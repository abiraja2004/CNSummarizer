Thomas, of San Jose, Calif., the first black to win a U.S. figure skating crown and the 1986 world champion, skated poorly Saturday after doing well earlier in the Games.
While the top two skaters in the world staged a shootout to music from Bizets Carmen, Manley was so sensational in the freestyle that she finished first with seven judges.
In addition to the three figure skating medals, the U.S. team had three speed-skating medals: one each gold, silver and bronze.
Sonja Henie of Norway was the only woman to do it before Witt, winning in 1928, 1932 and 1936.
Speed skater Bonnie Blair, Americas only double medalist, tried again Saturday in the 1,500 meters but finished fourth, well off the pace.
