The writs say that Goldman and Sheinberg made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than Dollars 47m in proceeds from the transfer of the 12.5m shares should go.
The writs allege that after the deal was struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to BIT.
On May 23 he told Goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to Bishopsgate Investment Trust, which Goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the Maxwell family.
