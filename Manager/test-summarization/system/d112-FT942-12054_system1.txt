Two writs have been filed alleging that Goldman Sachs, the US-based investment bank, assisted in diverting Pounds 55m from two pension schemes controlled by Robert Maxwell to ensure its own debts from Maxwell interests would be repaid.
The writs also allege that on May 28 1991 - the same date Mr Kevin Maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for - Goldman was due to receive Dollars 58.2m for an unrelated transaction selling MCC stock to an unnamed American lawyer with close connections to Robert Maxwell.
The writs allege that after the deal was struck Mr Trevor Cook, MGN pension fund administrator, told Goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme, but when Mr Kevin Maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to BIT.
