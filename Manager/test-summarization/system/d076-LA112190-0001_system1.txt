Ultimately, in the cold calculus of politics, the question that will most decisively sway Conservative MPs is whether they are more likely to win the next election with Thatcher at their head or someone else.
Polls show the Tories would do better in the next national elections with someone other than Thatcher leading them.
Thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home and a somewhat tiresome scold within the European Community.
But under Tory party rules, that margin, representing something less than a ringing endorsement, forces Thatcher to face a second round of voting on Tuesday.
Her government is deeply identified with high interest rates, inflation and a flat tax on every adult (in place of the property tax) that is generally regarded as hugely unfair.
