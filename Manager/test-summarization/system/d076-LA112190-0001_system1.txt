She led her party to victory in three elections, steered it through the war with Argentina to reclaim the Falklands, faced down the miners union in a long strike, moved -- often drastically -- to reverse Britains economic decline and won a prominent place on the world stage.
Thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home and a somewhat tiresome scold within the European Community.
Her government is deeply identified with high interest rates, inflation and a flat tax on every adult (in place of the property tax) that is generally regarded as hugely unfair.
Other candidates could choose to stand against her, perhaps diluting the opposition vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head.
