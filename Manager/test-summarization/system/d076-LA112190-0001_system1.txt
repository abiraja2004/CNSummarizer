Ultimately, in the cold calculus of politics, the question that will most decisively sway Conservative MPs is whether they are more likely to win the next election with Thatcher at their head or someone else.
Her government is deeply identified with high interest rates, inflation and a flat tax on every adult (in place of the property tax) that is generally regarded as hugely unfair.
Polls show the Tories would do better in the next national elections with someone other than Thatcher leading them.
Other candidates could choose to stand against her, perhaps diluting the opposition vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head.
