Charles Howard, a Royal Navy chaplain, asked the 300-member congregation inside the barracks, if you can find room in your hearts ... pray for the men who perpetrated this terrible act, that God will soften their hearts and turn them from their violent and evil ways.
Prince Philip on Sunday condemned the senseless killing of 10 Royal Marines musicians in an IRA bombing, and Britains defense secretary said he warned all military bases of the risk of similar attacks.
Many cried as Howard read aloud the names of the 10 servicemen killed during a coffee break between band practices.
The perpetrators of the latest outrage are at large and there is a risk of other attacks, King said.
