It took the drummer a long time to recover from Lennons murder the night of Dec. 8, 1980; he didnt even feel like working for the next few years - everything else suddenly seemed second rate.
Guys, Im taking off, Lennon would say as he poured himself another cup.
Once recording began, Lennon was just a working musician with the same goal as everyone else: finishing the album.
Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennons new album.
He didnt know him and was nervous about working with him.
