Drummer Andy Newmark was touring with Roxy Music in the summer of 1980 when he got the call that changed his life: He was to play on John Lennons new album.
Lennon defended his self-imposed retirement on Watching the Wheels and summed up his feelings about turning 40 on Borrowed Time, capping the line Good to be older with a self-assured you bet.
By this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did and be proud of it, Newmark said.
Milk and Honey was to come out the following year and Lennon wanted to tour, using many of the same musicians.
