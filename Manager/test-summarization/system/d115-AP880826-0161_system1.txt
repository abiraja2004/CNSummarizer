Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town, calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims.
Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.
Then they made a necklace of their shoes (by tying the laces together), put it around his neck and pulled him through the streets.
