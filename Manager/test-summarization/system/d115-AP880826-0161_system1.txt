Mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town, calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims.
Hyanju served in the Panchayat from 1981 until 1986 when he lost the backing of the Communists in Bhaktapur, traditionally a leftist stronghold.
Pashupati Rana, one of several Cabinet ministers who marched in the funeral procession, said several people were arrested in the killing, including the mayor, the deputy mayor and a member of the Rashtriya Panchayat, or non-partisan assembly.
Uttam Dhaubanjar, a 28-year-old bank employee and neighbor of the dead man, said Hyanju had been handing out blankets, milk and other food in Bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters.
