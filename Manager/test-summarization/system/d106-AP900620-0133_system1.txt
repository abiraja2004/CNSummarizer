Former tennis star Arthur Ashe: For me, one of my fondest dreams and hopes is to see Nelson Mandela free.
I feel humbled by being part of his welcome to our country.
The arrival Wednesday of African National Congress leader Nelson Mandela prompted an outpouring of praise and encouragement from politicians and supporters.
He and his people have suffered their way into the leadership of South Africa.
Mario Cuomo: Today we are celebrating Nelson Mandela and honoring his commitment to mankind.
He and his people have endured their walk through the desert of deprivation.
And now, his path is clear.
He emerged from the prison unbroken, unbowed and without bitterness, and he continues to struggle for human rights.
