Sen. Charles S. Robb (D-Va.) joined the Republican members as the panel first voted, 10 to 9, to send to the Senate floor the nomination of Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala to be ambassador to Spain.
Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years.
Then, in voice votes, the committee approved the equally controversial nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker, to be ambassador to New Zealand.
It also approved the nominations of Thomas Melady to be ambassador to the Vatican, William Howard Taft IV to be the permanent U.S. representative on the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, Keith L. Brown to be ambassador to Denmark, and Joseph Gildenhorn, a Washington lawyer and real estate developer, to be ambassador to Switzerland.
