Zappala reported to the committee that he contributed $126,000 last year to Republican campaigns and gave $17,900 in the previous two years.
The answer is to be found in the appendix, which lists the campaign contributions.
Then, in voice votes, the committee approved the equally controversial nominations of Florida real estate developer Marvin Sembler to be ambassador to Australia and Della Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker, to be ambassador to New Zealand.
His prior governmental experience, described on the ambassadorial evaluation form submitted to the committee, consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance committees for President Bush and the Republican Party.
