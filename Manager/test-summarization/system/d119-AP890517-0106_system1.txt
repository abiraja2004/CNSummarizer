The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panels chairman said he feared Secchia might embarrass the United States because of his penchant for making gross remarks.
But he said that since Secchia is the presidents choice he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it.
Italian friends of mine telephoned me from Rome, aghast at the prospect of having Mr. Secchia represent the United States in their country, the chairman said.
I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States, Pell said.
