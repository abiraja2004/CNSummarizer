The chairman, Sen. Claiborne Pell, D-R.I., and Sen. Alan Cranston, D-Calif., voted present, meaning they took no position.
The Senate Foreign Relations Committee today endorsed the nomination of Michigan Republican activist Peter F. Secchia as ambassador to Italy, but the panels chairman said he feared Secchia might embarrass the United States because of his penchant for making gross remarks.
I believe that this nomination is a mistake, and in all likelihood Mr. Secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the United States, Pell said.
At his confirmation hearing earlier this month, Secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast.
