The foreign media seems to think that by publishing news of aid from Salman Rushdie to earthquake victims, we will compromise on Rushdies fatwa (edict), Ayatollah Sadeq Khalkhali, known as the Hanging Judge, said in Tehran.
Rushdie donated the money to the Independent Iranian Earthquake Appeal, organized by the Independent newspaper to help survivors of the earthquake that Iranian officials said left at least 50,000 people dead.
I wanted to join the Independent and the hostage families and many other people in their appeal for contributions toward the needs of the Iranian earthquake victims, Rushdie said in a message delivered from his hiding place.
