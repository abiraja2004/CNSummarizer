Winging in from the West Coast (as was Walker) was Lauren Bacall, who teamed up with Phyllis Newman for a sly rendition of Ohio from Bernsteins Wonderful Town.
Her fellow cast members, Betty Comden and Adolph Green (who also teamed with Bernstein as the shows creators), after fondly recalling their 50-year friendship with Bernstein, poignantly sang the shows bittersweet finale, Some Other Time.
Since Lenny didnt like silence, Laurents asked instead for a final round of applause for the man who inspired and moved so many people for so many years.
The capacity audience -- invited friends, relatives and theatrical personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 a.m. -- heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in discos as well as a poignant account of his final days.
