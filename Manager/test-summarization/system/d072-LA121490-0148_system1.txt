The capacity audience -- invited friends, relatives and theatrical personalities as well as 850 members of the public who started lining up at 7 a.m. -- heard recollections of an energetic Bernstein who danced until dawn in discos as well as a poignant account of his final days.
Michael Wager, a very close friend of Bernsteins who was with him at the end, spoke movingly of how difficult it was for Bernstein to continue when illness had robbed him of his creative energy.
Another West Side Story collaborator, director-choreographer Jerome Robbins, had earned a laugh before he even spoke, thanks to Laurents introductory words: Fearless as Lenny was, there were two figures he did fear -- God and Jerome Robbins.
