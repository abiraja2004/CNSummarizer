Kuwaiti officials also asked that Iraq agree to demarcate the disputed border between the nations, a move Iraq has refused.
Iraq has historically laid claim to all of Kuwait and has long coveted the Kuwaiti islands of Bubiyan and Warba, which command access to Iraqs sole outlet into the Persian Gulf.
Iraq also demanded that Kuwait forgive $15 billion in loans it extended to Baghdad during the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
OPEC member states also agreed to a longstanding Iraqi demand to raised target crude oil prices from $18 to $21 a barrel.
Diplomatic sources have said they expect Arab mediators to push the two sides to sign a treaty of non-belligerency to be followed by protracted negotiations on borders and compensation.
