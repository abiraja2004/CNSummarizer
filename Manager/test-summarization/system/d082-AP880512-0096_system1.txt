Sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed that he write an apology for all the lies that were published, the paper said.
Past Soviet reports, published before Gorbachev became Soviet leader, accused Bonner of marrying Sakharov for his money and said the couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals between spouses.
But most of the newspapers circulation is among foreign tourists and readers abroad, so relatively few Soviets would see the Sakharov article.
While Sakharov was in exile in the closed city of Gorky, the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandal-ridden existence came to ask for an interview, Moscow News said.
