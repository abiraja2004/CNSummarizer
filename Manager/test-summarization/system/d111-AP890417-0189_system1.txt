The C-130 was able to drop a radio into the water near the boat carrying the 23 crew members and they were able to establish communications, Midgett said.
The two missing sailors were believed to be on a life raft, which was the object of a hunt Monday evening by the 950-foot Ravenscraig and five Navy and Coast Guard search planes, officials said.
The 23 sailors from the Star of Alexandria were found on a lifeboat and picked up by the merchant ship Ravenscraig, Coast Guard Petty Officer Randy Midgett said in New York.
The lifeboat was spotted around noon.
Visibility in the rough seas was five to eight miles Monday afternoon.
