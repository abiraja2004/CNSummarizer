The telescope, embarking on a 15-year search for new worlds, was released from the shuttles cargo bay Wednesday after a last-minute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk.
Discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the Goddard center make sure Hubble is operating properly, such as responding to directional commands.
One of the telescopes solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescopes batteries, which otherwise had only eight hours of charge.
Engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the TDRS, an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard.
