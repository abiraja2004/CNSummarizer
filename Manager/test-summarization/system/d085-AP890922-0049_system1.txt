This is a dangerous, killer hurricane, the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in Charleston have experienced, warned Mayor Joseph P. Riley Jr. Hugo was the first major hurricane to strike Charleston since Hurricane Gracie came ashore 70 miles to the south in 1959.
In recent years, the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches.
Measuring 7.7 on the Richter scale of ground motion, the earthquake claimed an estimated 110 lives, destroyed 102 buildings and tossed most of the citys 14,000 chimneys into the streets.
