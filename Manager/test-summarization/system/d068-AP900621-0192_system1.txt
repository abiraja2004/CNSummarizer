The envoys from the German states and the four World War II Allies that divided them were in East Berlin to discuss the international aspects of German unification.
The border crossing was the scene of stirring escapes and heartbreaking captures as East Germans tried flee to the West, breaking through East German control stations just 20 yards away from the Allied checkpoint.
Since East Germany overthrew its Communist government last fall and the German borders were opened, Checkpoint Charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling Berlin Wall.
With huge sections of the Berlin Wall being ripped down daily, U.S. officials decided two weeks ago to remove Checkpoint Charlie.
