A huge crane hung over the small house in the middle of the narrow street that leads to East Berlin, where a sign in English, German, Russian and French says: You are now leaving the American sector.
The envoys from the German states and the four World War II Allies that divided them were in East Berlin to discuss the international aspects of German unification.
The border crossing was the scene of stirring escapes and heartbreaking captures as East Germans tried flee to the West, breaking through East German control stations just 20 yards away from the Allied checkpoint.
With huge sections of the Berlin Wall being ripped down daily, U.S. officials decided two weeks ago to remove Checkpoint Charlie.
