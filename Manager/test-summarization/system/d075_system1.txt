In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Gregory D. Curfman, a deputy editor of the journal, cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays.
New treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before, perhaps even three days after their attacks, a study published today concludes.
The commentary noted a British study, also released in January, of 5,000 male physicians that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks, and that it was associated with a 2 1/2-fold increase in disabling strokes.
In patients whose hearts had pumping problems, the drug not only didnt help, but it increased the chance of a heart attack by 25 percent.
Doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value, the Food and Drug Administration said.
A drug that eases the hearts workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by 20 percent in people recovering from heart attacks, according to a major study released Thursday.
The public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past 20 years, said Dr. Myron L. Weisfeldt of Johns Hopkins University.
