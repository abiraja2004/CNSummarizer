Moslem separatists had warned Indian government officials to leave Jammu-Kashmir state before April or face the consequences.
Police said the border violence took place in Kupwara district, where at least 20 separatists tried to sneak into neighboring Pakistan to receive military training and buy weapons.
Moslem extremists abducted a leading businessman and an educator Friday and threatened to kill them, a day after authorities killed six militants crossing into Pakistan for arms and training, police said.
The caller claimed to speak for the Students Liberation Front, a branch of the Jammu-Kashmir Liberation Front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly Moslem state.
