The executives said the Saudis realize this would give the belligerent Saddam an excuse to attack and occupy the Saudi oil fields 150 miles south of Kuwait, giving Iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world.

The only tangible help Saudi Arabia gave the Kuwait government was to shelter members of the ruling family, including the emir, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and his crown prince.
