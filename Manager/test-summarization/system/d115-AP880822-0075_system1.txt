Many people were given shelter in schools, guesthouses and public buildings, but most of the people do not want to leave their homes, Shahi said.
Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least 3,000 people.
Ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked, Shahi said, adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone and older houses from mud and bricks.
More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well as the districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said.
