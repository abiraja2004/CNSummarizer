Witnesses in Darbhanga, an Indian city of 800,000 about 45 miles south of the epicenter, said the only warnings were hissing sounds, rattling doors and cracking windows.
More than 25,000 houses were flattened in Darbhanga, as well as the districts of Munger and Madhubani, Indian officials said.
Officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports from the remote Himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor, which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least 3,000 people.
Indian television today showed the devastation in the Indian state of Bihar: crumbled buildings, makeshift morgues lined with rows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds, damaged hospital wards packed with survivors.
