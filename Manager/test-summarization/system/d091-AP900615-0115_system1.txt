Belmont County Sheriffs Department spokeswoman Judy Phillips said a Shadyside bar full of people was washed away when water caved in the back wall.
Licking County was already among 14 Ohio counties covered in a disaster declaration issued by President Bush for storms earlier this month, and people who suffered losses from Thursday nights storms will also be eligible for assistance, Ms. Gilg said.
Shadyside Fire Chief Mark Badia said rescuers pulled people from three cars in Wegee Creek, which flows through Shadyside and into the Ohio River.
He said water was standing up to 5 feet deep in some streets on the citys east side, and the Newark Fire Department and other agencies used boats to evacuated some residents.
