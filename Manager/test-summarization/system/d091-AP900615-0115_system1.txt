Licking County was already among 14 Ohio counties covered in a disaster declaration issued by President Bush for storms earlier this month, and people who suffered losses from Thursday nights storms will also be eligible for assistance, Ms. Gilg said.
Temporary morgues were set up at Bellaire City Hospital and a funeral home in Shadyside.
Flood waters in most areas had subsided by Thursday night, the weather service and local authorities said.
Patty Valloric, director of the funeral home, said seven bodies had been brought there.
Four bodies were brought to the hospital from the Shadyside area, hospital spokesman Lawrence England said.
