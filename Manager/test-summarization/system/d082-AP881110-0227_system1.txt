The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip to the West, less than two years after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev freed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky.
Andrei D. Sakharov, the father of the Soviet dissident movement, finally received a 1973 human rights award Thursday night during his first trip to New York City.
Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the International League for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder, the former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
Sakharov is the honorary president of the league, which has its headquarters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate groups around the world, including the Moscow Human Rights Committee, which Sakharov and his colleagues founded in 1971.
