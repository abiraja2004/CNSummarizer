Sakharov received the Human Rights Award from the International League for Human Rights at a reception at the home of Ronald Lauder, the former U.S. ambassador to Austria.
The 67-year-old Nobel Peace Prize winner is on his first trip to the West, less than two years after Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev freed him from internal exile in the city of Gorky.
The human rights activist was banished in 1980 to the closed city for opposing the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan.
Sakharov is the honorary president of the league, which has its headquarters in the United States and more than 40 affiliate groups around the world, including the Moscow Human Rights Committee, which Sakharov and his colleagues founded in 1971.
