A worker at a building owned by the Madison County Jaycees said 42 people were staying there early today, and described the mood of the survivors as shock, mostly, and disbelief.
Huntsville Police Maj. Robert Moder said this morning that 463 people were injured by the twister, which plowed through a school and rural areas as well as a shopping mall and adjacent apartments.
His spokesman, Terry Abbott, said aerial surveys indicate the twister hopped along a 25-mile path, much of it straight through Huntsville.
He was among those called out to help dig through rubble for survivors or the bodies of the dead.
