The government on Thursday allowed for the possibility of a reunified Germany, but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect Polands borders.
Asked about German reunification at a news conference in Gdansk, Solidarity labor leader Lech Walesa said he prefers no political changes in Europe, but there should be all kinds of economic integrations.
Skubiszewskis speech seemed designed to reassure Poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on Polands current borders.
East Germany and West Germany each separately has recognized the border, but there has been no official assurance that a reunified Germany would also acknowledge the border.
