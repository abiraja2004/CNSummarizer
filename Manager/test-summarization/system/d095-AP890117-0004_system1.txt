Within hours of the schoolyard shootings that left five children and the gunman dead and 30 wounded Tuesday, dozens of translators rushed to assist the many Southeast Asian parents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of their youngsters.
Many of the parents speak no English and were unable to ask whether their children were among those killed or wounded when a heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded Cleveland Elementary School and opened fire before taking his own life.
They are not sure what happened, not sure whats going on around them, said Laura Dixon, of the Charterhouse Center refugee program, in Stockton, describing the scene translators found when they arrived at San Joaquin County General Hospital.
