Many of the parents speak no English and were unable to ask whether their children were among those killed or wounded when a heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded Cleveland Elementary School and opened fire before taking his own life.
A Stockton woman who runs an after-school program teaching English to Cambodian refugees dispatched 25 translators, including volunteers from all over the city, to the school and the hospital, Dixon said.
They are not sure what happened, not sure whats going on around them, said Laura Dixon, of the Charterhouse Center refugee program, in Stockton, describing the scene translators found when they arrived at San Joaquin County General Hospital.
