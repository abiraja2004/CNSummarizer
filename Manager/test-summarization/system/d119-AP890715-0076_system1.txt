Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy, declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors.
Sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such, noting that many of them compiled distinguished records.
Joseph B. Gildenhorn, the lawyer and real estate developer named by President Bush as U.S. ambassador to Switzerland, and his immediate family gave nearly $230,000 to Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show.
Other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the American Academy of Diplomacy include Florida real estate developer Joseph Zappala, nominated as ambassador to Spain; Melvin L. Sembler, a real estate executive in Florida named to be ambassador to Australia; and Della M. Newman, a Seattle, Wash., real estate broker named to be ambassador to New Zealand.
