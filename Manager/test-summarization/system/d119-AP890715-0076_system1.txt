Ambassador David Popper, president of the Academy of Diplomacy, declined to confirm that Gildenhorn and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors.
One of a lengthy and growing list of Bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, Gildenhorn gave $100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the Republican National State Elections Committee.
The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by Gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by Senate Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for Foreign Service professionals.
