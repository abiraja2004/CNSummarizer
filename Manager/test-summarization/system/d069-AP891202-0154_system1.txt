Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of the senators said Friday.
Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed to staying in the NATO military alliance of Western nations, the Indiana Republican said: Without any reservations.
Lugar said Kohl told the Americans that reunification would be a procedure that depends on many events in Germany and Europe and that the Soviet Union and the United States have a role to play.
Lugar said of Kohls proposals, There is much to work with there with regard to the future of Germany and the future of the (NATO) alliance.
