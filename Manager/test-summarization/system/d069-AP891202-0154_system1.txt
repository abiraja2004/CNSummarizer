Chancellor Helmut Kohl assured visiting U.S. senators on the eve of a superpower summit that West Germany will not forsake NATO to reunite with East Germany, one of the senators said Friday.
He strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified Germany be neutral, Sen. Richard G. Lugar, head of the American delegation, said of the Friday meeting with Kohl.
But the Soviets, who suffered millions of deaths fighting a unified Germany in World War II, have said the idea of German reunification is dangerous and unrealistic.
The dramatic events in East Germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the East bloc are likely to be a main topic of their talks.
