The bodies of four Moslems were found in a Kashmir town Monday, five days after they were kidnapped by Moslem militants agitating for secession from India.
The Kashmir valley, most of which falls in the Indian state of Jammu-Kashmir, is predominantly Moslem.
The deaths raise to 630 the number of people killed since security forces began a crackdown on the Moslem movement on Jan. 20.
The Hezbul Mujahedeen is one of more than a dozen Moslem organizations fighting for independence of the Kashmir valley from India.
Police officials also reported the death of one soldier in a militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of Baramulla, northwest of Srinagar.
