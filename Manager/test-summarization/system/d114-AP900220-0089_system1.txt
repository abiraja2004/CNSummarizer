The leaders of both countries have tried to soothe tempers in the dispute and have said another war over the region is unlikely.
A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight, said unlike the occasional shootings in the past, Indian soldiers appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troops.
Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged fire for several hours today after a Pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled Kashmir border, officers and a western observer said.
However, Pakistani forces have now sealed off the border area at Chaukothi, forbidding civilians from entering the area.
The border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on Feb. 11 between Indian troops and Pakistani students, who were marching in solidarity with activists in Indian-held Kashmir.
