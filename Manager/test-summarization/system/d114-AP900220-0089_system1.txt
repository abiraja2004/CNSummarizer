In another sign of increased tensions, Pakistani and Indian officers are no longer accompanying United Nations military observers as they pass through the borders.
A Paksitan army captain, who said he witnessed the firefight, said unlike the occasional shootings in the past, Indian soldiers appeared to be aiming at Pakistani troops.
They said there were no reports of casualties from todays firefight at the line, which divides Kashmir between Pakistan and India.
The border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on Feb. 11 between Indian troops and Pakistani students, who were marching in solidarity with activists in Indian-held Kashmir.
