Dr. John Schroeder, a cardiologist and professor at Stanford University, said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher.
But the bottom line is that this is the first study to show that diltiazem can be effective, Schroeder said.
Even so, the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug, which is now primarily used to treat angina, doctors said.
The drug was tested in 38 hospitals in the United States and Canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack, said Dr. Arthur Moss, a clinical professor of medicine at the University of Rochester and the principal investigator for the study.
