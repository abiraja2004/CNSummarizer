Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonalds Corp., said during the opening ceremonies, We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe.
The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of $2.57, or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town.
Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the McDonalds, suggested that the American restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of business.
