The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonalds in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun.
The Big Mac meal, consisting of a hamburger, soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of $2.57, or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous Pljeskavica joints around town.
The next East European McDonalds, and the first in a Soviet bloc country, is to open next month in Budapest, Hungary.
Sadik Seljami, a waiter in a small Pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the McDonalds, suggested that the American restaurant wants to drive Yugoslav fast-food outlets out of business.
