The Belgrade media have suggested that the success of McDonalds in Yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburger-like fast-food dish called the Pljeskavica: ground pork and onions on a bun.
Communism suffered its first Big Mac attack Thursday as McDonalds opened a restaurant in Yugoslavia, and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches.
The fast-food outlet, located on a downtown square, had drawn crowds in recent days, and they began gathering long before it opened Thursday.
Glen Cook, an executive of the McDonalds Corp., said during the opening ceremonies, We are very excited about the opening of this restaurant, not only because it is the first one in a communist country, but also because it is one of the nicest in Europe.
