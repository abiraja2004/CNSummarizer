Bild said Mielke and other members of Honeckers ruling circle will be moved to a West Berlin prison after German unification on Oct. 3.
One prison warden told Bild that many of the guards had worked for Mielkes Stasi and that they might interpret his threat against Honecker as an order to kill the former Communist chief.
Honecker was released from jail for health reasons.
West German authorities on Tuesday opened a criminal investigation of Mielke.
Mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police, known as Stasi, which built up files on 6 million East Germans and kept a tight rein on the population.
