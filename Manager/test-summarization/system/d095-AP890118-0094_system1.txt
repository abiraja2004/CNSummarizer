We will tell them they can survive this, said Kat Finkbeiner, a physical education teacher whose jaw was shattered in the shooting spree last year at Greenwoods Oakland Elementary School.
Its unhappy, but they can live through it; they can be happy another day, Ms. Finkbeiner said.
Eveline Higginbotham, the third-grade teacher in whose classroom the two little girls died, said the California tragedy just brings it all back again.
Weve lived through this.
I know we can help.
I would tell them, Lean on your community, share the sorrow.
It makes us more compassionate for these people, the principal said.
