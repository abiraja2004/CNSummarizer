Eveline Higginbotham, the third-grade teacher in whose classroom the two little girls died, said the California tragedy just brings it all back again.
I would tell them, Lean on your community, share the sorrow.
Im just in shock, she said.
We will tell them they can survive this, said Kat Finkbeiner, a physical education teacher whose jaw was shattered in the shooting spree last year at Greenwoods Oakland Elementary School.
Its unhappy, but they can live through it; they can be happy another day, Ms. Finkbeiner said.
A South Carolina school where a gunman killed two 8-year-old girls Sept. 26 will send cards and offer words of encouragement to a California school that lost five pupils in a shooting rampage.
