On the West Coast, about 50 people - part of an estimated 1 billion people worldwide who had access to the event - stood near Lennons star on the Walk of Fame and listened to the Imagine broadcast: Imagine all the people, living life in peace You may say Im a dreamer, but Im not the only one I hope some day youll join us And the world will live as one.
The biography by Albert Goldman, The Lives of John Lennon, depicts the former Beatle as an anorexic bisexual addled by drugs who raged his way from Liverpool to New York.
It tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his step-sisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date, who between songs at a Beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the Dykins girls out of the front row, away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage.
When Albert Goldmans The Lives of John Lennon was published in September, depicting the former Beatle as riddled with vices, faults and neuroses, Ono called it totally fiction.
Hence this 718-page stew of unrelieved sordidness, percolating with the scoops that have by now been widely publicized in People magazine, West 57th and other scholarly venues: that Mr. Lennon had a thing for young boys; that his marriage to Ms. Ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage; that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldnt quit.
