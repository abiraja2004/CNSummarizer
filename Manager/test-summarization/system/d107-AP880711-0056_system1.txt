If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.
As a result, world grain stocks are projected to fall below 310 million tons, or 17 percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security, the report said.
Potential crop losses from the pests could hit 1 million tons, FAO said.
If crop conditions in the United States and Canada continue to deteriorate, the ratio could drop even further.
It said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed countries.
