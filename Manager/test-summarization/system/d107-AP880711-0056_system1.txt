If the drought in the United States ended now, grain production would fall close to the low levels of 1983, when a drought and farmers participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output, the agency reported.
The crippling drought hitting North America is expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries, the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization reported today.
The agency projects world cereal production in 1988 to total 1.785 billion tons, only two million tons more than last years level, which was already below the expected production.
The high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor, food-importing countries the hardest, the U.N. agency warned.
