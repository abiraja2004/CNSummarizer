The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be one of the worlds richest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and started hand-writing merchandise prices for customers so their bills could be tallied on calculators quickly.
He also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in the Wal-Mart cheer.
Walton often attends promotional events for his Arkansas-based chain, and Sively said he had suspected the boss might make an appearance.
He was up there saying, Give me a W, give me an A, and the customers went right along with him, Sively said.
Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana Jea in its parking lot.
