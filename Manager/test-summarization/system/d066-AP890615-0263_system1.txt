The 71-year-old Walton, considered to be one of the worlds richest people, grabbed a note pad Tuesday evening and started hand-writing merchandise prices for customers so their bills could be tallied on calculators quickly.
People began recognizing him and coming up and greeting him, said store manager Paul Sively.
He also joined the singer on stage to sing a duet and led customers in the Wal-Mart cheer.
He was up there saying, Give me a W, give me an A, and the customers went right along with him, Sively said.
Walton, known for his down-home style, made a surprise visit to the store that later Tuesday staged a concert by country singer Jana Jea in its parking lot.
