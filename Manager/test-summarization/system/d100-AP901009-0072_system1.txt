Lennon always symbolized for us somebody who was able to handle rock and roll with a sense of humor and later, even more importantly, as someone who cared for the rights of an individual, human rights in general, and who had the right concept of freedom and peace, said Ondrej Konrad, the editor of Czechoslovakias leading popular music publication.
Jeff Pollack, head of the California-based Pollack Media Group, proposed the idea to Ono, who gave it the go-ahead.
In celebration of Johns life, lets use our power of dreaming, Ono said.
The tribute coincides with the release of a four-compact disc set of 73 songs, including 61 written by Lennon.
