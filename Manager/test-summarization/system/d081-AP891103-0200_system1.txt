The Komsomolskaya Pravda youth newspaper, in an article giving a sympathetic view of the workers conditions in the Arctic Cirle coal-mining districts, said many miners do not see daylight for months because of their underground work and the sun dips below the horizon in the winter.
Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of the House of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline for implementing reforms.
Thousands of miners in the northern Vorkuta region are expanding their strike and some are blocking coal shipments, the Soviet news media reported Friday.
The miners are demanding the government fulfill promises of improved living and job conditions.
