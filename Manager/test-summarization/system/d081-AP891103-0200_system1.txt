Coal miners in the northern region and the Ukraine struck for two weeks this summer but returned to work in July after parliament passed a resolution promising reforms, including improved social and economic conditions.
The news media gave these accounts of the latest strikes: Workers at the Vorgashor mine in the Arctic Circle, the largest mine in the Vorkuta region, continued their strike for an eighth day, according to Tass.
Tass said that in Donetsk the miners gathered in front of the House of Unions to demand that the government set a deadline for implementing reforms.
Soviet officials have said the strikes could force fuel rationing during the Soviet Unions severe winter.
