Authorities charged a 22-year-old ferry captain with negligent homicide after the boat, overcrowded with New Years travelers, sank off the Caribbean coast.
Officials said 46 people survived the sinking of the ferry Justo Rufino Barrios II in Amatique Bay on Guatemalas east coast Sunday.
He said by telephone that the ferry ran out of fuel midway on a 16-mile run across the bay from Livingston to Puerto Barrios and sank after a naval patrol boat tried to tow it to port.
Giron Arreola also said that passengers ran to one side of the ferry while it was under tow just before the ferry sank.
