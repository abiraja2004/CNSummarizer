Last Friday a series of car bombs exploded in Bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on Indias commercial heart.
The attacks in Calcutta and Bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence, which has caused deep shock throughout India.
The identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over 250 people were killed and at least 1,200 injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the Indian business capital of Bombay.
Most of the estimated 125 people living in the Calcutta flats were in their beds when the blast occurred, setting fire to both buildings, according to officials in the citys central control room.
