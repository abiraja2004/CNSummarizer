The crowd, which stood respectfully and silently during a traditional funeral ceremony, waved banners and wore buttons honoring the martyrs of Tiananmen Square and calling for democracy in China.
After the service and several speeches, the crowd marched through the streets of Chinatown, led by a casket and a traditional Chinese funeral bier containing fruit and incense.
This has united the Chinese people for one cause _ to overthrow the government and establish democracy, said Peter Lee, one of the student organizers of the service.
The funeral procession stretched for blocks through Chinatown, tying up traffic.
They then marched through the streets in a funeral procession.
