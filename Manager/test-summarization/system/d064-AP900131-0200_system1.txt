Big Macs were priced at 3.75 rubles and double cheeseburgers at 3 rubles _ about two hours pay for a starting McDonalds staffer or the average Soviet, but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently.
McDonalds of Canada Chairman George Cohon, the man behind the deal, said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served 15,000 to 20,000 people in just the first five hours of operation.
Half the days sales were donated to the Soviet Childrens Fund, which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children, Gary Reinblatt, senior vice president of McDonalds Canada, said from Toronto.
