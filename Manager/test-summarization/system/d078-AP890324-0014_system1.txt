But despite the Academys crusade against crass commercialism, this years awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle: Some 800 limousines delivering the most famous stars to the Oscar telecast will be equipped with door-mounted coolers jammed with Diet Coke, Coca-Cola Classic and other Coca-Cola Co. beverages.
The Academy insists that a contract signed by Oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the Academy for a nominal fee.
When Malcolm Willits, the book stores owner, announced that he would hold a February auction for the 1957 best-picture trophy for Around the World in 80 Days, the Academy said enough, initiating a court action that, for now, has blocked any future trophy sales.
