I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men, women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war.
He may not have had that kind of influence now, but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with religious vigor.
At the surrender of the Imperial Japanese government, Hirohito was spared punishment because it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors.
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us.
