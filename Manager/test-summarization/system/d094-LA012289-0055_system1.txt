I only wish that the soul of Emperor Hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men, women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war.
He may not have had that kind of influence now, but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in Japan with religious vigor.
The political and military role that Emperor Hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us.
I found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age, in his position, in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries.
