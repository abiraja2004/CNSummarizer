Ever since the 1906 earthquake devastated San Francisco, many scientists have believed the next big one would strike the Los Angeles end of the mighty San Andreas Fault.
But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area.
The quake was centered on the San Andreas segment described in the article, but Tom Heaton, the scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey office in Pasadena, said it wasnt clear yet whether it broke all or part of the 50-mile segment.
