Scholz pointed to evidence that the 1906 quake didnt relieve as much stress in the Santa Cruz Mountains as other scientists believed.
The 1985 study, by Columbia University geology professor Christopher Scholz, was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened Tuesday.
These studies gave various interpretations of how much stress inside the Earth was released by the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906, which had a magnitude of about 8.3 and killed at least 2,500 people.
But studies in recent years have reminded the Bay Area that it also faced another seismic disaster, and those studies became a reality Tuesday when a quake measuring 6.9 on the Richter scale rocked the Bay area.
