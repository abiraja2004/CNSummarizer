it was measured at  inches breaking the  inches recorded for the  hurricane that devastated the florida keys
thats the lowest pressure ever measured in the western hemisphere said forecaster mark zimmer
gilbert is a category  storm the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane

sam walton was arguably the most important retailer of his generation
the son of an oklahoma realestate broker he opened the first general store in what was to become the walmart chain in bentonville in the backwaters of arkansas in  writes martin dickson
by  the chains sales had risen to nearly dollars bn making it the worlds largest retailer in terms of revenues and the walton family probably americas richest
walmart now operates in  us states selling goods ranging from detergents to golf clubs
the chains success stemmed both from mr waltons personality and willingness to challenge accepted retailing orthodoxy
he was a frugal modest man who worked extremely long hours from a spartan room in his bentonville headquarters but delighted in getting out of the office to tour stores and meet customers and staff whom he insisted on calling associates
he would deliver peptalks to employees extolling the virtues of thrift and customer satisfaction long before these became fashionable management buzzwords
employee satisfaction  an idea which is only now gaining wider acceptance in us service industries  was also a vital ingredient in the walton philosophy
he buoyed staff morale with cheerleading sessions bonus payments for good performance and profitsharing plans which allowed some employees of very modest means to retire relatively wealthy
eight years ago when walmarts profits were better than expected he kept a promise to staff by dressing in a grassskirt to dance the hula on wall street
also essential to walmarts growth was its pioneering of high volume cutprice retailing throughout the year rather than the periodic sales which rivals relied on to generate customer loyalty
low prices always became walmarts motto
mr walton also disproved the conventional wisdom that large discount stores could not operate successfully in the small rural towns of the us south
it was precisely such locations which became the bedrock of the business though in the process walmart put out of business hundreds of small main street stores prompting bitter resistance in some towns which mr walton tended to blunt with generous charitable donations
while hurricane hugos  mph wind roared outside mayor joseph p riley jr watched the fury it vented on his beloved yearold city
riley city officials and a few reporters stayed in charlestons historic city hall through thursday night as the areas worst hurricane in three decades pounded the coastal city where the civil war began
late in the day there was hope hugo might spare charleston
but the storm gathered strength and speed as it spun straight toward this city which had survived a number of near misses from great storms in recent years
from the moment it became apparent hugo might strike the southeast coast many charlestonians conceded that this time their number was up
as hugos wind howled outside the plywood boards protecting the windows reporters wandered in and out of rileys office
on his desk several candles burned as insurance against the inevitable loss of power
later there was a sharp crack as a piece of the tin roof ripped off and water seeped down on the burnished wood tables in the city council chamber
phone and electric service to the city command post was knocked out
during it all riley kept in close contact with the national weather service
as the eye of the storm passed he took reporters onto the porch of the yearold brick city hall to look at the damage
the initial view sketched out in the glow of flashlights was unsettling the tin roof was tossed in the gutter slate tiles were scattered on the ground
bricks sticks and leaves littered the street
this is the eye of the hurricane
ive never been in one and i hope im never in one again riley said
its scarcely a late summer breeze
as the storm died before dawn riley was out on the streets again in a raincoat carrying a flashlight to get a better assessment of the damage
serious but fixable the mayor concluded
world leaders from president reagan to malaysias king mourned todays death of emperor hirohito who surrendered a broken nation to the allies in world war ii but presided over its rise to economic preeminence
reaction to hirohitos death at age  however was decidedly cool in several asian countries including south korea which endured years of harsh colonial rule by japan
while south korea president roh taewoo sent his condolences a government party statement added we reserve further comment considering the unhappy past and the current koreajapan relationship
the main opposition party led by kim daejung said we have complex feelings at the death of hirohito in view of japans year rule over korea during his reign
a leading newspaper in seoul the joongang daily news wrote that hirohitos death reminds all the korean people of a disgraced period and  humiliation
 hirohito is the symbolic figure who must assume most and final responsibility for japans preposterous crimes to the korean people
korea was divided into the communist north and the capitalist south in  when us and soviet troops ended japans rule that began in  with japans forced annexation of the peninsula
there was no official comment from the nationalist chinese government because of the lack of diplomatic relations between taiwan and japan but the mass circulation chinese daily united evening news said asian people who suffered from the slavery and invasion of japans militarists during world war ii may bury their animosity with hirohitos death
 chinese suffered the most from the japanese invasion
it was an irony that while hirohito apologized to the united states and europe for the war he did not direct a single word to china to show his sorrownow hirohito has died
we may not want to collect the reparations but we shall never forget the painful historic lessions
in the united states president reagan said in a statement his majestys year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous and yet at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind  an age of unprecedented economic collapse a most vicious war astonishing scientific acheivement and dramatic political and social changes throughout the world
it was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation
his majesty played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two peoples to an end reagan said referring to hirohitos decision to end world war ii
in new zealand prime minister david lange said hirohitos death marks the end of an era
during his reign he saw the transition from the most turbulent period in japans modern history to the stability and prosperity of today lange said
president corazon aquino of the philippines sent condolences to the imperial family and her foreign secretary raul manglapus a japanese prisoner of war during world war ii praised hirohito as a stabilizing factor in the creation of a democratic japan
he provided a figurehead that kept the japanese people firmly committed to peaceful means of achieving their national goals manglapus said
condolences also came from king sultan mahmood iskandar of malaysia to hirohitos oldest son crown prince akihito who immediately ascended the chrysanthemum throne
prime minister bob hawke of australia paid his respects in a message to japanese prime minister noburu takeshita throughout his long life the emperor was held in the highest esteem by his people
now as japan enters a period of mourning and prepares for a new age our thoughts are with you
but bruce ruxton an official of the returned services league which representing almost  australian war veterans said there would not be too many tears shed around the world
he described hirohito whose role in the war has been debated as one of the worst war criminals
marine biologists paid homage to another facet of the monarchs life  his  books published on hydrozoa or sea animals
robert hessler of the scripps institution of oceanography in la jolla calif said hirohito preferred the quiet study to his destined role as leader
the poor man didnt really get to do what he wanted to do
he had to be emperor first then second a scientist and normal human being hessler said
deaths from heart and blood vessel disease dropped  percent over the past decade but it remains by far the nations biggest killer taking a life every  seconds the american heart association said sunday
the good news is that we continue to see an improvement in the death rate from the biggest killer of our population said dr bernadine healy of the cleveland clinic foundation who is president of the heart association
those trends are dramatic and dont seem to be reversing she said
the bad news is that heart disease is still killing almost  million americans a year and weve got a long way to go
the association released the statistics at its annual forum for science writers
experts attribute the decline in death rates to a combination of healthier living habits including fewer cigarettes and better food and improved medical treatment
the public ought to appreciate the progress that has been made in heart disease over the past  years said dr myron l weisfeldt of johns hopkins university
its almost unbelievable
there is almost no form of heart disease that we cant approach without meaningful treatment
however weisfeldt who is presidentelect of the heart association also cautioned that much work remains both in improving care and encouraging people to take better care of their health
i believe we can prevent at least  percent of the ischemic heart disease in the united states by the year  if we stop smoking get cholesterol treated if its above  and identify and treat hypertension he said
ischemic heart disease is the clogging of blood vessels that feed the heart
it underlies most heart attacks the single most lethal heart ailment
association figures indicated that in   the most recent year for which there are statistics  an estimated  americans died from heart attacks strokes and other diseases of the heart and blood vessels
cancer the no
 killer took  lives
between  and  the death rate from all forms of cardiovascular disease fell  percent
it declined  percent for heart attacks and  percent for strokes
the associations figures show that more than one in four americans suffers some form of cardiovascular disease and almost half of those eventually die from it
about  percent of the heart attack deaths occur before the victim reaches the hospital
studies show that about half of all heart attack victims wait more than two hours before getting to an emergency room
weisfeldt said a major health goal is getting people to go to the hospital within three or four hours of the first sign of heart attacks
during this period there is still time to give them drugs to dissolve the blood clots that are causing their heart attacks
this treatment can save lives and reduce the disability of heart attacks
other major goals he said include finding ways to improve the effectiveness of angioplasty a technique that uses balloons to open clogged heart arteries and finding surgical and medical techniques to identify and protect people at risk of cardiac arrest
the heart association estimates that cardiovascular disease will cost  billion this year in medical expenses and lost wages
among other statistics released by the association the most common cardiovascular disease is high blood pressure which affects  million americans
about  of the deaths from cardiovascular disease each year occur in people under age 
there were  heart transplants in  almost nine times as many as in 
about  million americans have angina the chest pain resulting from clogged heart arteries
about  new cases occur annually
as many as  million americans will have heart attacks this year
saudi arabia an oilrich ally of kuwait has been subdued in its reaction to iraqs invasion of kuwait
the only direct saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official saudi press agency the day after the iraqi move
it did not condemn thursdays invasion
it said saudi arabia was following the kuwait situation with extreme concern and that king fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interests of all
the only tangible help saudi arabia gave the kuwait government was to shelter members of the ruling family including the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and his crown prince
both nations are tightly run by royal families
the saudis also allowed them briefly to operate a radio reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the saudikuwait border
it broadcast calls for resistance to the iraqis
but on friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call the people of kuwait appeal to you oh brethren oh arabs oh beloved brothers oh moslems rush rush to their help
it was not known if the radio had been discovered by the iraqis or shut down by the saudis to avoid provoking iraqi president saddam hussein at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade saudi arabia as well
oil executives said saudi arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against iraq  closing the pipeline that carries iraqi oil for export across saudi arabia to the red sea
the executives said the saudis realize this would give the belligerent saddam an excuse to attack and occupy the saudi oil fields  miles south of kuwait giving iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world
turkey also has refused to comment about president bushs suggestion that turkey cut off iraqs oil pipeline to the mediterranean
two parallel pipelines pump iraqi crude oil to a terminal at yumurtalik at the eastern corner of turkeys mediterranean coast and constitute iraqs major oil export outlet
the saudis did condemn the invasion as part of a joint statement issued by the gulf cooperation council in which it is allied for economic and security cooperation with kuwait the united arab emirates qatar oman and bahrain
the six states issued a statement saying we strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that one arab state took against another arab state
 we do not recognize anything resulting from it
iraqs huge armed force is clearly too much for the joint man gulf cooperation council force based at hafr albaten in northeastern saudi arabia  miles south of kuwait
but there was no talk of specific action against iraq by kuwaits partners
saudi arabia was also one of the  members of the member arab league that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the gulf cooperation council
the arab league with onethird of its members voting against the resolution or abstaining was clearly unable to take any direct action
the late jesse owens whose performance at the  olympics put the lie to hitlers boasts of racial superiority picked up a fifth gold medal wednesday for humanitarian contributions in the race of life
president bush presented the congressional gold medal to his widow ruth owens in a ceremony at the white house also attended by three daughters and teammates of the track legend
this saturday marks the th anniversary of owens death at age 
the president later hailed owenss multiple gold medals in the berlin games a victory for humanity in prepared remarks to a banquet sponsored by the us olympic committee
the olympics like democracy are a kind of dialogue  a way that nations can converse in the language of friendly competition not deadly conflict bush said
bush called owens who was black an olympic hero and an american hero every day of his life  born with the gift of burning speed
he was always the fastest said bush recalling the afternoon in may  when the ohio state runner broke three world records and tied a fourth in the space of  minutes
talk about a guy in a hurry bush laughed
he was the epitome of that
at the  olympic games in berlin owens captured four gold medals  in the broad jump meter dash meter dash and meter relay
the berlin games were to be the showcase of hitlers theories on the superiority of the master race until this yearold kid showed up bush said
it was an unrivaled athletic triumph
but more than that it really was a triumph for all humanity
bush borrowing a phrase from ruth owens said it was not those athletic feats but his humanitarian contributions in the race of life that earned owens the congressional gold medal
owens devoted himself to working with youth and serving as a special ambassador for sports said bush
he said the athletes legacy lives on through the jesse owens games a playground olympics the jesse owens international trophy for amateur athletes and the jesse owens foundation which awards scholarships to needy youth
despite the many honors his greatest satisfaction came from his work with youth said mrs owens 
attending the ceremony along with owens family were former olympians mal whitfield harrison dillard and herb douglass former teammates john chavers samuel devine and chester thomas and two ohio democrats sen howard metzenbaum and rep louis stokes who spearheaded the drive to strike the medal
the silverhaired mrs owens standing outside the white house afterwards called the event absolutely beautiful
she added im sure with the sun shining straight down jesses watching us too
margaret thatcher set the example of what a woman could achieve in british society but her critics say she did little else to help women along
for some it was enough that her political career reached the heights
one woman wrote to the independent newspaper last week that her yearold daughter wondered what title mrs thatchers successor would hold since he couldnt be called prime minister thats a girls name
emma nicholson a conservative party lawmaker said it was once unthinkable that a woman would ever be a british prime minister
she has broken the mold once and forever ms nicholson said in an interview
mrs thatcher who trained as a chemist before studying law said she viewed herself as prime minister not as a woman
she believed the battle for womens rights had been largely won and was no believer in feminism
what has it ever done for me
she once asked
mrs thatcher who stepped down on thursday urged women to get involved in politics but did little to pull them up the ladder
several female lawmakers were appointed to junior executive posts in various ministries but the only woman to serve in a thatcher cabinet was baroness young leader of the house of lords from  to 
the truth is that although mrs thatcher is a woman she doesnt believe in the advancement of women clare short a labor party lawmaker said last month
edwina currie a former junior health minister said any other prime minister would have had several women in and out of the cabinet
its margarets fault that the only people standing to succeed her wear trousers mrs currie said last week
trree men are vying to succeed her as conservative party leader and thus prime minister in a vote by party lawmakers set for tuesday
traditional male attitudes remain strong in britain from the uppercrust allmale clubs of london to the topless women pictured daily in the tabloid press
women are paid less than men and are poorly represented in management jobs and in parliament
however campaigners for women rights say there are encouraging signs at the grassroots
the critical mass of women have entered middle management in government and business said lesley abdela a founding member of the  group
the group seeks equal representation for women in the seat house of commons which now has  female members
women represented  percent of the british labor force in  compared with  percent in  when mrs thatcher became prime minister
britain has a higher proportion of working women than other european community countries
though mrs thatcher never made a priority of womens issues she did introduce some helpful legislation tax concessions for workplace nurseries independent taxation for married women and legislation to compel absent fathers to pay child benefits
but as prime minister she angered feminists by often emphasizing womens traditional roles of homemakers and caregivers
angela rumbold the conservative partys minister for womens issues contends that an enormous amount has been done for women during the thatcher years
im not sure what she could have gone beyond promoting people who were there just because they were women she said in an interview
margaret thatcher is a great meritocrat
she believes in getting people to succeed on their merits
jo hawkins of the  group which is seeking equal numbers of women in the house of commons believes mrs thatchers extraordinary abilities made it difficult for her to understand the needs of the average woman
she would say that anybody can do it just stick to your principles and get up and do it ms hawkins said
i think because of her character her personality and her amazing selfconfidence she isnt aware of how the normal person struggles
after years of delay and a lastminute snag the hubble space telescope was freed from the shuttle discovery on wednesday and glinting in the sunlight drifted into orbit on its year search for new worlds
mission specialist steven hawley released hubble from the end of the shuttles footlong mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescopes solar wings unfurled
the first of nasas great observatories is now on station at  nautical miles above the earth mission controls jeffrey carr said
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work discovery commander loren j shriver said later
the  billion telescope was released at  pm edt as the shuttle entered its th orbit of earth nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned
the shuttle then backed away
thank you very much for the ride said mike harrington director of orbital verifications at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had been in the shuttles airlock ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel
that proved to be unnecessary
close but no cigar but better for the hubble that it went the way it did sullivan said
she and mccandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission
the first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday wednesday as the shuttle passed  statute miles or  nautical miles above south americas eastern coast
it started providing power to the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge
deployment of the starboard panel however was more troublesome
it wouldnt budge when latches were first released then moved about a fifth of its foot length and stopped again
a third attempt rolled the panel out all the way
houston we see motion commander loren j shriver reported
hawley began the long process of releasing hubble shortly after  am edt when he grasped it with discoverys footlong mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the ton telescope high above the shuttle
hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickelhydrogen batteries
at one day seven minutes into the flight of discovery hubble is now on its own internal power carr said
the game has begun
the race is on
the clock is ticking
worries that the telescopes instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out
television cameras aboard discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily the sun reflecting off the goldcolored panel and silvery telescope
discovery was  statute miles above earth  miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown
the orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the earths distorting atmosphere
discoverys five astronauts were awed by the view
id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today shriver said of hawley
astronomers have waited seven years for hubble to take its place in space
the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in  but technical problems and the challenger explosion pushed it back
the mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on discovery forced the national aeronautics and space administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before april s scheduled liftoff
on tuesday discovery finally blasted into space transporting hubble out of this world and in search of others
the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened friday exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
discovery was following hubble in case the door does not open properly
if a problem develops mccandless and sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space
fred wojtalik hubble project manager said the telescope would be tested thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
the telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments
if all goes well the crew will land sunday at edwards air force base calif nasa expects to release its first image from the telescope  of an open star cluster in the constellation carina  on tuesday
data will follow in a month or two
astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to earth for  billion years
they expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed currently estimated at  billion years ago
the telescope is named for the late american astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s that the universe was expanding
he also was responsible for helping to form the big bang theory of creation
the quick collapse of a bizarre military revolt on the philippines secondlargest island leaves president corazon aquinos beleaguered government with a muddied victory at best and clear danger signs ahead
analysts here say aquinos immediate use of small bombers and artillery to end a pocket rebellion led by renegade army col alexander noble on the north coast of mindanao helps counter oftheard criticism that her fouryearold government is indecisive and inept
and despite widespread fears that the oct  uprising would quickly spread to military garrisons on other islands and become a major threat to aquino leaders of the rightist military underground failed to move
it was the coup attempt that didnt catch fire one western diplomat said
it sort of fizzled before anything could happen
but he and other diplomats see little benefit for aquinos battered image overseas
the international consequence is people saying yet another revolt in the philippines
its like shes under a perpetual onslaught he said
moreover questions linger as to how noble and about  rebel troops so easily evaded a muchpublicized military manhunt to drive  miles from their mountain sanctuary pass unhindered through at least  military checkpoints and seize two military camps including the command post of the general who had been ordered to capture him  all without firing a shot
noble once chief of staff of aquinos own security detail quickly linked up with reuben canoy a local politician who heads the socalled mindanao independence movement
the resourcerich island has spawned secession groups since the th century  though canoys is the first to print fake passports and currency based on crude counterfeits of us  bills
the whole thing was kind of a farce one asian diplomat said
only in the philippines
noble best known for his long goatee and red stocking cap quickly surrendered with most of his motley army of soldiers and higaonon tribal militiamen after two world war iivintage t planes called tora toras here bombed and strafed one of the camps
one plane later crashed and the pilot drowned the revolts only fatality
aquino has now survived two major coup attempts and half a dozen assorted and aborted military mutinies
most ended in embarrassing standoffs or dragged on for days as top military leaders hedged on ordering troops to fire on other soldiers
in one case mutineers were ordered to do pushups and attend bible class as punishment
this time was a different government response altogether which noble clearly had underestimated said university of the philippines political scientist alex magno
he expected another standoff and hoped for other camps to defect
he got bombed instead
after the revolt the government toughened its anticoup law boosting the maximum penalty from  years to life in prison
aquinos spokesman tomas gomez iii urged other rebel leaders to take the honorable way out  suicide
ironically noble made his move on the day a presidential factfinding board issued a longawaited page report on the causes of last decembers coup attempt in manila which left more than  people dead
after  witnesses  sworn statements and  documents the socalled davide commission concluded that coup attempts are likely to continue  but unlikely to succeed  for the indefinite future
commission member delfin lazaro estimated that  officers involved in last decembers coup attempt which came closest to toppling aquino are still at large and still plotting
its going to be very difficult for them to get the critical mass to launch a successful coup he said
but theyll keep trying
what else can they do
east germanys ousted secret police chief threatened to break former communist leader erich honeckers neck when the two faced each other in jail a west german newspaper reported wednesday
you traitor
yearold former security chief erich mielke shouted at honecker according to bild newspaper
mielke also screamed at honecker ill break your neck
the newspaper quoted witnesses as describing the scene when the two met in an east german jail
honecker  was jailed for one day in january
mielke for years headed the dreaded secret police known as stasi which built up files on  million east germans and kept a tight rein on the population
he was one of honeckers closest aides
after the popular revolt last fall that ousted the communist regime and opened the way to german unification mielke and other former communist leaders were jailed
mielke remains in custody
honecker was released from jail for health reasons
west german authorities on tuesday opened a criminal investigation of mielke
he is suspected of giving sanctuary to members of west germanys leftist terrorist group the red army faction and of setting up contacts between the group and palestinian guerrillas
honecker is also the target of several criminal investigations one in west germany for obstruction of justice
bild said the imprisoned mielke also accused other former communist officials of betrayal and threatened to retaliate against them
one prison warden told bild that many of the guards had worked for mielkes stasi and that they might interpret his threat against honecker as an order to kill the former communist chief
bild said mielke and other members of honeckers ruling circle will be moved to a west berlin prison after german unification on oct 
honecker also will be moved to the same jail if his health improves enough for him to be imprisoned
he is suffering from kidney cancer and is being kept at a soviet military hospital oustide east berlin
comrade wen jiabao member of cpc central committee secretariat and his party left changsha for zhuzhou and xiangtan yesterday
he inspected the flooded areas including zhuzhou citys xiawan dike the hexi new and high technology development zone and linghuayuan and xiangtans yangtianhu xingxiadi zhoujiangdi and shiwandalou where rescue and relief work was in full swing
after listening to reports submitted by the two cities on their efforts to fight the flooding and do relief work he issued important instructions
comrade wen jiabao fully affirmed the initial victories that the two cities have scored in their flood fighting and relief work under the leadership of the provincial party committee and government
he said in fighting floods and doing relief work the broad masses of cadres and people in zhuzhou and xiangtan sacrificed their interests to rescue a large number of industrial and mining enterprises the beijingguangzhou railway the  national highway and cities and thus minimized the losses caused by floods
this fully shows that with party leadership and the socialist system we will be able to overcome all difficulties
regarding the work in the next stage he pointed out we should continue to take flood fighting and relief tasks as the focus of our current work and simultaneously do a good job of reform opening up to the outside world stability other fields of work and industrial and agricultural production
he said after the water recedes we should firmly grasp the opportunity and repair the damaged dikes and embankments
as the highest flood season has not yet arrived we should be prepared at any time to meet new flood peaks headon rather than slacken our efforts
we should try every possible means to provide food clothing and shelter to flood victims pay special attention to preventing and curing diseases and concentrate efforts on the resumption of production and the reconstruction of homes
he particularly stressed the current flooding has revealed problems in the construction of water conservancy facilities and urban flood control
in the past inadequate consideration has been given to urban flood control and the coordination of urban and rural flood control
in the next step we should earnestly draw a lesson from this negative experience
governor chen bangzhu urged the party committees and governments of zhuzhou and xiangtan to convey comrade wen jiabaos regards and instructions on behalf of the party central committee and the state council for the broad masses of cadres and people to the party committees and governments at all levels as soon as possible earnestly implement them and effectively carry out the work of fighting floods doing relief work and helping oneself by engaging in production
the irish republican army claimed responsibility for a huge explosion friday that reduced a threestory military barracks on the southeast coast of england to rubble killing  people and injuring  eight seriously
it would be one of the outlawed iras deadliest attacks on the main british island
nine marine musicians and one civilian died in the blast which also damaged dozens of nearby homes and could be heard two miles away
the musicians were between the ages of  and  as are most of the recruits in the school
a police spokesman said forensic experts are still trying to determine with certainty that the explosion was the result of a bomb
but he said the characteristics of the blast and a statement claiming responsibility appeared to confirm that it was the work of the ira
security sources said they believe that at least two ira active service units each composed of four or five members are operating in britain and continental europe
one member known as the jackal after the assassin in the frederick forsyth novel the day of the jackal has been eluding the authorities for two years
he has been identified as patrick sheehy and has been linked to the iras last successful mainland bombing attack  on an army barracks at mill hill in august 
one soldier was killed in that incident
sheehy and another wanted irishman john conaghty were linked to an ira bomb factory in north london that the police stumbled upon last december while in pursuit of a car thief
a search turned up automatic and semiautomatic weapons ammunition  pounds of semtex high explosive and a hit list of  british political figures and other officials headed by prime minister margaret thatcher
fridays explosion occurred about  am in a lounge at the royal marines school of music near deal on the english channel in the county of kent

appalling outrage defense secretary tom king visited the scene and called the bombing an appalling outrage committed against unarmed bandsmen  people who worked for charity who have given great enjoyment to millions right across the country right across the world
the real evil of these murders is that the people who commit them the godfathers who send them to commit them know that they will actually achieve nothing
terrorism is not going to win
we shall find the people responsible for this outrage sooner or later as we have already found some of those responsible for the earlier outrages and they will be brought to justice
the authorities have been on high alert expecting ira attacks in connection with last months th anniversary of the introduction of british troops into northern ireland
the republican underground organization opposes british rule in the predominantly protestant province and is fighting to join the mainly roman catholic south in a united independent ireland
visit to ulster but in a statement telephoned to a dublin news agency ireland international fridays attack was linked to thatchers visit last week to units of the controversial ulster defense regiment in northern ireland
the locally recruited overwhelmingly protestant ulster defense regiment has come under fire in connection with an investigation into the leak of secret government lists of suspected ira members to protestant assassination squads
it is widely hated by the catholic minority in the province and the irish government in dublin has urged britain to disband the force
mrs thatcher visited ireland with a message of war at a time when we want peace the statement claiming responsibility for the deal attack said
now in turn we have visited the royal marines in kent
but we still want peace and we want the british government to leave our country
the statement was signed p oneill irish republican publicity bureau a signature that has appeared on earlier ira bombing claims
fridays attack was the worst on the mainland since the virtually simultaneous bombings of july  directed at ceremonial military units in londons hyde park and regents park
eleven bandsmen and mounted guards were killed in those incidents
eight persons were killed by ira car bombs outside harrods department store here in december  and  were killed and  injured in two birmingham public house bombings in the fall of 
an attempted barracks bombing was averted last february when a sentry came upon two intruders who had managed to get inside a military camp in shropshire
there has been a series of bomb and automatic rifle attacks this year on british soldiers and their families stationed in west germany
earlier this month an ira gunman shot to death an army wife heidi hazell  in her car near her home at dortmund
leonard bernstein the renaissance man of music who excelled as pianist composer conductor and teacher and was as well the flamboyant ringmaster of his own nonstop circus died sunday in his manhattan apartment
bernstein known and beloved by the world as lenny died at  pm in the presence of his son alexander and physician kevin m cahill who said the cause of death was complications of progressive lung failure
on cahills advice the conductor had announced tuesday that he would retire
cahill said progressive emphysema complicated by a pleural tumor and a series of lung infections had left bernstein too weak to continue working
in recent months bernstein canceled performances with increasing frequency
his last conducting appearance was at tanglewood mass on aug 
bernstein was the first americanborn conductor to lead a major symphony orchestra often joining his new york philharmonic in playing his own pieces while conducting from the piano
he etched other niches in history by composing the indelible west side story and teaching a generation about classical music via the innovative television series omnibus
exhibiting remarkable talent and expertise in four areas that most artists wish they possessed in merely one bernstein still might have remained an obscure musician without the unique theatrical flair that dominated his personal as well as professional life
with it he became a personality well known even to people who never bought a ticket to a musical performance or watched a serious television show
the dervish persona including his upstart gymnastics on the podium never lessened throughout his long life in the spotlight
he made classical music understandable and palatable to the masses
and he lifted popular music to a higher plane infusing performers and listeners with his manic joy in creating tonal sound
some conductors mellow with age commented times music critic martin bernheimer when bernstein conducted the los angeles philharmonic at ucla in 
but bernstein at  remains a frenetic combination of orbiting rocket aerobics master superjuggler matinee idol booming cannon hysterical mime heartrending tragedian bouncing ball sky writer riveting machine mawkish sentimentalist and danseur ignoble
describing the conductor in the same concert bernheimer referred to him as the shrugging jumping sighing soaring gushing crouching rocking rolling bounding bobbing leaping jiggling stabbing hunching bumping grinding and grunting maestro in excelsis
critics also were quick to agree that had his envied and oftencriticized showmanship masked lazy sloppy or inept musicianship bernstein could never have remained an internationally soughtafter conductor for five decades
he knew what he was doing and the musicians he accompanied wrote for conducted or lectured to and taught admired him as one of their own
louis bernstein sonamed because his maternal grandmother insisted was born aug   in lawrence mass to two russian jewish immigrants
his father samuel joseph bernstein was an entrepreneur of womens hair care products and a talmudic scholar
his mother jennie resnick bernstein who survives him said her son always had an ear for music
when he was  or  he would play an imaginary piano on his windowsill
the parents preferred the name leonard and called the boy that
when his kindergarten teacher asked louis bernstein to stand up he remained seated and looked around the room to see who shared his last name
bernstein changed his name legally at age  when he got his first drivers license
his mega musical talent emerged belatedly and almost by accident
when bernstein was  a divorcing aunt stored her old upright piano with his parents and the boy who used to play at the windowsill became fascinated with it
he asked for lessons and soon was playing better than his teacher a neighbors daughter who charged  a lesson
by age  he was studying at the new england conservatory of music and had determined despite his fathers objections that music  at that point playing the piano  would be his career
bernsteins stunning instinctive talents for sightreading remembering complicated scores and improvisation became evident as he played and altered classical jazz and popular music
he produced his own shows and versions of the mikado and carmen and performed as piano soloist with his school orchestra and the state symphony orchestra
he reveled in music while excelling in athletics and the classical subjects taught at the yearold boston latin school
at harvard university bernstein studied piano and composition but developed a serious interest in composing only after meeting american composer aaron copland
a fan and practitioner of his music bernstein met copland in a typical itcouldonlyhappentolenny incident
invited to a dance recital in new york bernstein sat in the balcony next to a man he did not recognize
invited afterward to a postrecital birthday party for copland bernstein commandeered the piano and played coplands piano variations
his performance captivated the man he had met in the balcony who of course was copland
they became lifelong friends
copland introduced bernstein to several composers and got him his first job  transcribing music for the publisher boosey and hawkes
ironically copland subsequently urged the torn bernstein to make conducting rather than composing or even piano playing his career
conducting emerged as a possibility to bernstein that same year   his sophomore year at harvard  when he met the greek conductor dimitri mitropoulos during the maestros visit to campus
mitropoulos was so impressed with bernsteins playing that he invited him to attend rehearsals with the boston symphony
the maestro also talked with bernstein privately in his dressing room after concerts promising to keep in touch
the influence of mitropoulos on my life on my conducting life is enormous and usually greatly underrated or not known at all bernstein wrote years later after his mentors had all died because ordinarily the two great conductors with whom i studied are the ones who receive the credit for whatever conducting prowess i have namely serge koussevitzky and fritz reiner
but long before i met either of them i had met dimitri mitropoulos 
and watching him conduct those two weeks of rehearsals and concerts with the boston symphony laid some kind of conductorial passion and groundwork in my psyche which i wasnt even aware of until many years later
graduated from harvard and out of work after a summer in new york bernstein asked mitropoulos what he should do
you must be a conductor mitropoulos replied urging him to study at juilliard or with reiner at curtis institute in philadelphia
it was fall and conducting classes at juilliard were full so bernstein went to philadelphia for two years
during the summers he studied under koussevitzky conductor of the boston symphony at the new school koussevitzky was starting at the orchestras summer home tanglewood
he became like a surrogate father to me bernstein later said of koussevitzky his third major conducting mentor
he had no children of his own and i had a father whom i loved very much but who was not for this musical thing at all
and so i found another father first mitropoulos then reiner and now koussevitzky
but the koussevitzky relationship was very special very warm
bernstein later became koussevitzkys assistant and returned to tanglewood annually to conduct and teach
he so revered the maestro that he was married in koussevitzkys shoes and white suit and always conducted wearing his cuff links
it was koussevitzky  and fate  who arranged bernsteins meteoric ascension to worldclass conductor at the unheardof age of 
on his th birthday aug   bernstein was told by the koussevitzkys that he should visit artur rodzinsky newly appointed music director of the new york philharmonic at his stockbridge conn farm
i am going to need an assistant conductor rodzinsky told him
i have gone through all the conductors i know of in my mind and i finally asked god whom i shall take and god said take bernstein  he said granting the position as a favor not to god but to koussevitzky
remarkable as his appointment was considering that he was an american and so young bernstein was given little chance of actually taking the podium
in the orchestras history no assistant conductor had ever been called on
but for lucky lenny history made an exception
on nov  less than three months after bernstein got the job guest conductor bruno walter fell ill and rodzinsky was snowed in at his farm
jennie tourel had sung bernsteins i hate music at her town hall debut the previous night in itself an event big enough to bring his parents to town and he had played for her and the postrecital party
with no rehearsal a hangover and three hours sleep bernstein was to conduct a complex program broadcast nationwide on cbs radio
the new york times chronicled the epic event on page one and stated in an editorial mr bernstein had to have something approaching genius to make full use of his opportunity
its a good american success story
the warm friendly triumph of it filled carnegie hall and spread over the airwaves
bernstein was not to get his own orchestra until he took over the new york philharmonic in 
he had no time for one
he was too much in demand around the world as the wunderkind guest conductor
successful as a pianist composer and conductor bernstein according to joan peyser in a controversial biography consulted psychiatrists because of his internal conflict over the three pursuits
it is impossible for me to make an exclusive choice among the various activities bernstein wrote in 
what seems right for me at any given moment is what i must do
the ends are music itself 
and the means are my private problem
the piano became an occasional solo onstage or a celebrated party pastime
bernstein concentrated seriously on composing while developing and commercializing his conducting career
his first major composition a symphony titled jeremiah was introduced in  and his first ballet fancy free and related first musical on the town both debuted in 
he sought to be a classical composer winning plaudits for symphonies jeremiah was followed by the age of anxiety in  and kaddish in  sonatas and the operas trouble in tahiti in  and a quiet place in 
in writing music bernstein achieved greater success on broadway and even in hollywood than in lincoln center
he followed on the town with the musicals wonderful town in  the score for the film on the waterfront in  and the critically acclaimed but less popular candide in 
his best and bestremembered work west side story debuted in 
if i can write one real moving american opera that any american can understand and one that is notwithstanding a serious musical work i shall be a happy man bernstein said in 
when many suggested a decade later that he had achieved his dream with west side story he disagreed saying there are moments when i think so but as a sum total it fails to be an opera
because at the denouement at the dramatic unraveling the music stops
but i dont love it any less he added reveling in the adulation his adaptation of the romeo and juliet conflict had produced
it doesnt make it a stepchild or a foundling
in teaching his fourth area of expertise bernstein taught regularly at tanglewood and won his place in academic annals with his charles eliot norton lectures on tonality at harvard in 
it was on television in the s and s with his young peoples concerts of the philharmonic and omnibus that bernstein taught the nation
an assessment of bernstein must include his talent and contribution as a teacher and popularizer of music a role that has set him apart most from other performers conductor historian and bard college president leon botstein wrote in harpers in 
instinctively adept at television bernstein became a prototype for carl sagan alistair cooke and others now familiar on instructive programs on the public broadcasting system
bernsteins programs botstein said displayed his gift for analyzing and enthusing about classical music without sacrificing the integrity of the score its complexity or its simple genius
no one before or since bernstein has been so effective  artistically and commercially  in proselytizing and bringing alive serious music to a mass audience
the television classics won bernstein a coveted peabody award
bernstein was able to apply his innate ability for commercializing his art that had made him wealthy to the struggling new york philharmonic
he introduced free concerts in the park and put the orchestra on television widening its audience and tripling paid concert attendance
he left the orchestra in  after a record year tenure at the helm to have more time for composing and guest conducting
if two rings of the bernstein circus rested in popular and classical music the third was anchored in his uproarious personal life
known for his emotional embraces of both sexes bernstein loved crowds and kept friends and family with him throughout the night at his manhattan apartment or connecticut country home
a heavy smoker and drinker who partied or worked until dawn and slept until noon he claimed he composed or studied scores even when surrounded by people
god knows i should be dead by now he said as he approached  characteristically cavalier about his health
i smoke
i drink
i stay up all night
im overcommitted on all fronts
i was told that if i didnt stop smoking id be dead at 
well i beat the rap
raising the highbrow music worlds eyebrows bernstein campaigned with other celebrities for the civil rights of blacks in the s and against the vietnam war in the s
criticized for radical chic his leftist political philosophy prompted him to host a storied fundraising party for the black panthers in 
in  he rejected a national medal of the arts in protest of the withdrawn  grant later reinstated of the national endowment for the arts to an art show on aids
although peyser made a strong case in her  biography that bernstein had many homosexual affairs bernstein promised his children never to read the book there was no question that he adored his family
on sept   he married chilean actress felicia montealegre and despite a short separation and subsequent reconciliation in  remained devoted to her and went into a severe depression when she died of lung cancer in 
bernstein is also survived by two daughters jamie and nina as well as his sister shirley and brother burton
spokeswoman margaret carson said the funeral would be private
staunchly opposed to retiring until last tuesday bernstein continued his guest conducting composing and recording perhaps topping his more than  records with the best of his best a rerecording of west side story in 
the effort became deutsche grammaphons alltime bestselling record and prompted will crutchfield to write in the new york times that bernstein was in a class with giuseppe verdi
french president francois mitterrand saluted west side story anew in  when he made bernstein a commander of the legion of honor
after a nationwide series of concerts and parties celebrating his th birthday in  bernstein said with uncharacteristic modesty i have no further requests of the fates 
except for time
ive achieved more than i had any right to expect
nobody has been as lucky as i have
superstar lenny too much talent too little time says martin bernheimer
he is the most important person ever to come out of this town and even as the world considers his fitness for the presidency huntington is celebrating his life in what is ambitiously being billed as the premiere dan quayle memorabilia exhibit
 to those who say quayle does not merit his own exhibition quayle devotees say with a mixture of defiance and dignity that he is after all the vice president of the united states
 were preserving history says david schenkel the exhibition coordinator
a century from now someone may want to do a dissertation on him
 if so huntington will be ready
 relatives former classmates and longtime neighbors of quayle have donated yearbooks report cards poems letters his little league uniform a coffee cup he drank from a chair he once stood on during the  presidential campaign and just about anything else he ever touched wrote signed or posed for
 the vice presidents mother corinne donated a lock of his baby hair
the  indianapolis  queen produced a picture of quayle then an aide to indiana gov
edgar whitcomb accompanying her to the race
and a former housekeeper turned in a yearold piece of carpeting she saved from one of quayles floors
 the exhibition which runs through may  was put together by the dan quayle commemorative foundation a sort of fanclubturnedarchive devoted to documenting the life and times of the nations th and they say leastunderstood vice president
 he has taken such a bad rap said schenkel a foundation board member
if people knew him theyd see hes a regular person
if they had a chance to sit down with dan as a neighbor they would see the extremely good values in the man
 these are the faithful who have long since stopped expecting good press on their man
instead they measure news reports on him by their relative negativity describing the best coverage as more upbeat or halfway decent
 they defend the relatively young age of quayle who turned  in february all he needs is a little seasoning his limited experience look at what they said about truman  he was a haberdasher and his passion for golf he has to have some form of relaxation
but they are careful not to stretch the superlatives
the description nice comes up a lot
 hes not the fool that the talk show hosts think he is says dottie watson president of the republican women of huntington county
hes a very nice person a capable person
everybody i know says he can do it
 that is not to say some people dont have some friendly advice for quayle
if he would slow down talk an octave lower and think about what hes saying i dont think people would take him the way they do said jean anne drabenstot the owner of nicks kitchen quayles favorite restaurant
 hayden schenkel chairman of the huntington county democratic party and a distant cousin of david schenkel says some people would shudder and shiver if he accidentally became president of the united states
most of the democrats and even some of the republicans would say theyre tickled to death to have him as vice president and theyre  percent behind him
but in all due respect we sure hope nothing happens to president bush
 quayle has declined an invitation to attend the tribute citing a busy schedule
nonetheless most of huntingtons  residents have rallied around their native son for the exhibition which tracks his life from infancy through law school from the senate to the vice presidency
 the free exhibition has turned a gray room in the towns public library into a virtual dan quayle museum
the display patches together pieces of a life that until the last decade was strikingly ordinary
 there is dan quayle and his brother chris riding horseback and wearing cowboy hats or sitting in front of the fireplace in their pajamas at christmas
there is dan quayle with his vacation bible school class dan quayle with the high school golf team dan quayle at  or  years of age with sharon mceachern when they were named king and queen of the swim festival at the fort wayne country club
it is all very s very middle american almost surreal in its innocence
 there are windows into the workings of the quayle family too
for example his father james signed the report cards when dan brought home poor grades and his mother signed when he brought home good ones
 and there are letters and poems that he wrote which only go to show that one does not have to be a yeats to make it in politics
dan wrote this rather thoughtful verse on nov   when he was  years old my dad is very very nice but he is not made of sugar and spice
 sometimes he acts as if he has been disturbed but at other times he is as cheerful as a bird
 the exhibit also includes the  newspaper announcement of dan and marilyn quayles wedding the wooden quayle  quayle shingle the couple hung when they opened their law practice here and assorted campaign souvenirs including the official air sickness bag from the  republican national convention
 ultimately the foundation wants to build a repository for the memorabilia
it has already organized a walking tour of historic quayle sites like the white ranchstyle house where he spent his early days and nicks kitchen where he likes to order tenderloins fries and a milkshake
 we want everybody to know hes a winner  i dont care what the newspapers say said marge hiner one of the exhibit organizers
what a role model for our children to know that you can be a normal person come from a normal family and become vice president of the united states
iraqs powerful army invaded this small oilrich kingdom early today
tankled troops quickly seized the rulers palace and government buildings and the emir fled to saudi arabia kuwaiti officials said
kuwaits us ambassador said the iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the countrys oil facilities
he appealed for us military intervention
a pentagon source said us navy ships were diverted to the region but president bush said the subject of intervention was not being discussed
the iraqis have occupied all of kuwait
a kuwaiti government official shouted in a telephone interview
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf estimated that more than  kuwaitis were killed or wounded
the iraqi government of president saddam hussein claimed it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free kuwait
kuwait and un diplomats labeled the coup report a farce
the assault followed two weeks of tension between kuwait and iraq caused by iraqi accusations that kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area
saddam also accused kuwait of exceeding opec production quotas thus driving down the price of oil a major iraqi revenue source
the attack had wideranging ramifications oil prices soared  a barrel in early trading because of fears the invasion would disrupt supplies
prices were about  higher later
president bush signed orders freezing iraqi assets in the united states and blocking most iraqi imports including oil
oil accounts for  percent of iraqi imports to the united states and makes up about  percent of us oil consumption
bush also froze kuwaiti assets to prevent iraq from seizing them
the soviet union iraqs main arms supplier halted weapons sales
the un security council voted  to denounce the invasion and demanded immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops
a pentagon source said the aircraft carrier uss independence escorted by a sixship battle group was diverted from the indian ocean toward the gulf where other us ships were already patrolling
secretary of state james a baker iii planned to fly to moscow to issue a rare joint statement friday with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze about the invasion
the plan which was announced in washington illustrates the dramatic improvement in relations between the superpowers who once routinely lined up on opposite sides of most regional disputes
kuwaits us ambassador sheik saud nasir alsabah told reporters in washington we are desperate for any help we can get
he appealed specifically for american intervention
in recent days diplomats said iraq had massed more than  troops at the border
kuwaits entire armed forces has  soldiers
bush said the united states would take whatever steps necessary to defend interests in the gulf
asked if this included military force bush said were not discussing intervention
but he said he would not discuss military options publicly
it was the first time in modern history an arab nation had invaded another and taken over its government
kuwaits army was no match for iraq battlehardened after eight years of war with iran
iraq has emerged as the arab worlds strongest and most militant military power and saddam has a vast arsenal of chemical and conventional weapons
diplomats said about  iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after crossing the border  miles away at dawn
witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious
the invaders surrounded the palace of kuwaits ruler sheik jaber alahmed alsabah
residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy artillery barrages
diplomats said sheik fahd alahmed alsabah one of the emirs brothers was killed while trying to defend the palace
there were about  tanks around the palace and the neighboring american embassy residents said
the alsabah family has ruled the citystate for almost  years
the kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in saudi arabia
operating from an unknown location alahmeds government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating kuwait is kuwait to its people let by the emir sheik jaber and his crown prince sheik saad
god preserve them from all harm
for its part the provisional government announced through baghdads official iraqi news agency that it was dissolving parliament and would hold free and honest elections at a future date
the iraqi forces were led by the elite republican guard which did the brunt of fighting in the iraniraq war
troops set up roadblocks at major intersections and shot at cars that did not stop
baghdad television said iraq qould withdraw its forces within days or weeks depending on how quickly the situation stabilized
kuwaits land and sea borders were closed as was the airport
diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the evacuation of nationals and foreigners were asked to keep a low profile
there are about  americans among the large expatriate community in kuwait where more than  percent of the  million residents are foreigners
us officials monitoring the situation had no reports of harm to us citizens in iraq white house spokesman roman popadiuk said
foreigners reached by telephone said they watched from their windows or dived for cover as the invasion began
we were totally unprepared said catherine baker of illinois
one feels like there should have been a bit of warning
the british embassy was hit by shellfire and the sheraton and hilton hotels evacuated their clientele the diplomats said
the invasion came hours after iraq broke off talks intended to mend its differences with kuwait
iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally kuwait two weeks ago
washington declared its support for kuwait from the start
during the iraniraq war american ships protected usflagged kuwaiti tankers from attacks in the gulf
hurricane andrew claimed to be the costliest natural disaster in us history yesterday smashed its way through the state of louisiana inflicting severe damage on rural communities but narrowly missing the lowlying city of new orleans
the storm which brought havoc to southern florida on monday and then headed northwest across the gulf of mexico had made landfall late on tuesday night some  miles southwest of the city in the agricultural cajun country
although the damage from the hurricanes landfall in florida on monday was much greater than initially esti mated insurers losses there are likely to total less than dollars bn well below earlier expectations a senior member of lloyds insurance market said yesterday
in louisiana the hurricane landed with wind speeds of about  miles per hour and caused severe damage in small coastal centres such as morgan city franklin and new iberia
associated tornadoes devastated laplace  miles west of new orleans
then however andrew lost force as it moved north over land
by yesterday afternoon it had been downgraded to tropical storm in that its sustained windspeeds were below  mph
initial reports said at least one person had died  been injured and thousands made homeless along the louisiana coast after  confirmed deaths in florida and three in the bahamas
the storm caused little damage to louisianas important oilrefining industry although some plants had to halt production when electricity was cut
the lloyds member in close contact with leading insurers in florida said that damage to insured property was remarkably small
more than dollars bn of damage may have been caused in all but was mostly to uninsured property he said
in north miami damage is minimal
worst affected is one hotel whose basement was flooded
most of the destruction occurred in a mile band across homestead  miles to the south of miami where a typical house sells for dollars  to dollars 
us insurers will face a bill in respect of such properties but lloyds exposure there is minimal
many destroyed power lines are thought to be uninsured as are trees and shrubs uprooted across a wide area
only one big hotel in that area has been badly damaged a holiday inn
across florida some m people remained without electric ity yesterday and health officials were warning the public to boil or chemically treat all water
hurricane hugo which devastated much of south carolina in  cost the insurance industry some dollars bn
further uninsured losses may have raised the total to dollars bndollars bn
british prime minister john major said today that iraqi troops will have to be forcibly removed from kuwait if president saddam hussein does not agree to withdraw them peacefully
major just as unyielding in talking about hussein as was his predecessor margaret thatcher rejected the notion that a partial iraqi pullback from kuwait would help bring about a solution to the crisis
a complete withdrawal is necessary a partial withdrawal wont do major said in a display of solidarity with us policy on the persian gulf
on the gulf issue at least majors remarks augured well for his talks with president bush late in the day at camp david the maryland presidential retreat where the two leaders were planning an overnight stay
major who arrived here thursday night for a hour visit wasted no time in going on a rhetorical offensive against hussein using a succession of four television interviews aired shortly after dawn
if he stays in kuwait in a country which essentially at the moment is rather like a prison camp a country that hes dismantling day after day then he will have to be forcibly removed major said
i hope it wont come to that  everyone hopes it wont come to that  but it could
at the same time major demonstrated the kinder gentler face he has brought to british politics since his accession showing none of the abrasiveness that was a thatcher hallmark
in contrast to thatcher he was polite to reporters questioning him
comparing major and thatcher one us official said the biggest change is personal style
consistent with the us view on the gulf major said there is nothing whatsoever to negotiate about
hussein he said has to go

chief petty officer lance vickery recalls waves tumbling into the stern of the bobbing ferry headed back to the uss saratoga and joking whoa looks like were flooding
only minutes later his words came true turning a simple ride back from christmas shore leave into a harrowing fight to survive
the israeli ferry tuvia capsized shortly after midnight on saturday throwing more than  men into the cold waters of haifa bay
at least  sailors drowned and scores were injured
the sailors were part of the multinational force arrayed against iraq
vickery  was among four american sailors interviewed at haifas rambam hospital
he is from jacksonville fla is not far from mayport the saragotas home port
three of the sailors said the boat had been taking on water over the stern in heavy seas then capsized when it was hit by a big wave
vickery said the fatal wave came about a minute after he had cracked his joke
all of a sudden i saw water just come flying in he said
and it was maybe two seconds and the boat rolled right over
the year veteran sailor found himself trapped in the ferrys cabin frantically struggling to find a window as the ship sank
i started breathing in water and almost died vickery said
if i had been under the water maybe another  seconds i wouldnt be lying here right now
id be in one of those body bags out there
when he made his way to the surface he found guys floating everywhere screaming and yelling like chaos
despite his own predicament he grabbed a struggling fellow sailor by the collar and dragged him toward a floating plastic foam life ring
one rescue boat already overloaded passed by and threw life preservers
in what seemed like an hour another boat came also full
so they just dragged us through the water back to the saratoga and i was a real happy person to see those guys snatching me up he said
as vickery was being treated for bleeding lungs caused by water inhalation his hospital roommate seaman michael benjamin  of san antonio texas was recovering from a neck injury suffered when a rescue boat hit him while he was in the water
both were wearing blue hospital pajamas and when they walked to the visiting rooms balcony could see the saratoga anchored outside the haifa harbor
benjamin who has been in the navy for just a year said the ferry had been jostled in heavy seas
as we were going on the waves i just noticed one that was bigger than normal and then another one that was bigger than normal he said
the next thing i know all i saw coming in was water he said
benjamin said he dove from the ferry then had to swim frantically to get away from the suction of the sinking boat
clinging to a foam plastic float he was passed by one rescue boat and hit by a second
i looked around and i see this big hull coming at me and we were all yelling but i guess the ship didnt see us he said
i was trying to get out of the way but i got hit by the ship
dazed benjamin stripped off his jacket shirt and shoes and kept treading water until he found a piece of driftwood to cling to
i was scared he admitted
i was having a hard time staying up in the water
a rescue ship picked him up he estimated about a half hour to  minutes later
two other men interviewed at rambam hospital identified themselves as technician john richards  of twin lake mich and airman lamont jones  of claremont va
both were breathing with difficulty despite gas masks
richards recalled seeing a large wave and feeling the ship heeling to one side
all i can remember thinking is oh my god its sinking and then i was scrambling for my life he said faintly
the visit by human rights activist andrei d sakharov to the united states has gone virtually unreported by state media with a radio broadcast saying only he had voiced opposition to the us star wars program
that report from radio moscow carried on its internationalservice news programs tuesday apparently was the only mention made by soviet media of sakharovs visit to the united states which began sunday
radio moscow said sakharov made the comments about the reagan administrations spacebased antimissile program at a boston news conference

a celebrity in the west since he helped form the soviet dissident movement of the s sakharov spent nearly seven years in internal exile after criticizing the kremlins military drive into afghanistan
president mikhail s gorbachev allowed him to return to moscow in december 
some statements and articles by sakharov have been printed in the soviet media since then including an article last week in a magazine that opposed some elements of gorbachevs blueprint for political and electoral reforms
other activities by sakharov have gone unreported here including his delivery to gorbachev of a list of  soviets reportedly held in prison labor camp or psychiatric hopsitals because of their political views
the official tass news agency reported wednesday that the organization sakharov belongs to  the international foundation for the survival and development of humanity  held its first session in boston the previous day
tass made no mention of sakharov in its threeparagragh report but said the soviet delegation to the meeting was headed by yevgeny velikhov vice president of the soviet academy of sciences

it estimated for example that corn output this year would shrivel to  billion bushels down from  billion last year

more than  workers at a coal mine in the southern city of jastrzebie went on strike today to demand legalization of solidarity and higher wages a spokeswoman said
the strike in jastrzebie about  miles southwest of warsaw comes on the eighth anniversary of the founding of the outlawed trade federation
solidarity spokeswoman katarzyna ketrzynska said workers on the overnight shift at the manifest lipcowy mine stayed outside the mine shaft all night and were joined by workers arriving for the morning shift
she said security officers blocked miners on the afternoon shift which starts at  pm from entering the grounds to join the striking miners
the strike began at noon today according to katrzynska
she said the miners are demanding the legalization of solidarity and reinstatement of workers fired for union activities
the workers are also calling for higher wages and better working conditions and are requesting two lawyers and two economists to assist them in the negotiations
manifest lipcowy is the second mine in the industrial region of silesia to experience unrest
workers at the rudna copper mine near the city of wroclaw staged a protest rally monday to demand improved safety conditions and the return of solidarity activists to work
three members of solidarity were barred saturday from working
solidarity was crushed in  when the government imposed martial law and was banned nearly a year later by parliament
on aug   workers at factories around the northern port of gdansk joined striking shipyard workers to form solidarity the first and only independent trade federation in the soviet bloc
a drug used to treat patients complaining of chest pain also could help prevent recurring heart attacks in four out of five heart patients according to a study published in todays edition of the new england journal of medicine
surprisingly however the study found that the drug diltiazem increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack in patients whose hearts pump abnormally experts said
even so the results may trigger an increase in the use of the drug which is now primarily used to treat angina doctors said
the drug was tested in  hospitals in the united states and canada on patients who had recently suffered a heart attack said dr arthur moss a clinical professor of medicine at the university of rochester and the principal investigator for the study
the results suggest the drug may be quite effective in decreasing the likelihood of a second heart attack in the majority of patients moss said
but the study also surprisingly suggests that patients who suffer pulmonary congestion should not be given diltiazem because the drug increases the chance of a subsequent heart attack
we now know when to prescribe this drug and when not to moss said
thats what this study was all about
diltiazem is a calcium entry blocker the newest class of drugs to be introduced in the fight against heart disease
nitrates and beta blockers are the other types commonly prescribed by doctors
the study involved  heart attack patients who were given either  milligrams of diltiazem a day or a placebo
patients were recruited from  to  and followed for  to  months
overall the drug only decreased additional heart attacks  percent which was not statistically significant moss said
but in patients who had normal or nearnormal heart pump function   patients or  percent of the total group  diltiazem decreased the chance of another heart attack by  percent moss said
in patients whose hearts had pumping problems the drug not only didnt help but it increased the chance of a heart attack by  percent
dr john schroeder a cardiologist and professor at stanford university said he was surprised that the drug increased the chance of heart attack in any group and that overall results were not higher
but the bottom line is that this is the first study to show that diltiazem can be effective schroeder said
i think it will mean that more patients will be routinely put on this drug on a longterm basis
dr george beller a cardiologist and professor at the university of virginia said he was also somewhat surprised about the increase in heart attacks in the group suffering pulmonary congestion
this is one of the first reports that seems to identify that he said
diltiazem and two other calcium entry blockers were introduced in the past decade beller said and research into how effective they are in various applications is in its early stages
nitrates have been used for more than  years and beta blockers were developed in the s
here are some quotes on iraqs invasion of kuwait the iraqi government firmly believes and states that iraq is pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations with kuwait

conductor leonard bernstein has canceled several performances in japan due to exhaustion and lingering illness and will return to the united states to recover his manager announced today
leonard bernstein is suffering from exhaustion as a result of trying to fulfill his professional obligations while not having fully recovered from several ailments he suffered this spring
complete rest for an extended period is required if this remarkable man is to regain his usual high energy level said dr kevin cahill the conductors personal physician
bernstein  has suffered from severe influenza pleurisy and pneumonia since the beginning of the year cahill said in a statement released by harry kraut bernsteins manager
dr angelo aquista an associate of cahill flew to japan to accompany the conductor back to new york it said
kraut did not provide the time or date of bernsteins departure
bernstein had been scheduled to conduct the london symphony orchestra in four performances in japan ending with a concert on july 
bernstein issued a separate statement apologizing to his fans and sponsors and saying that he had asked lso principal conductor michael tilson thomas and japanese conductor eiji oue to fulfill his conducting responsibilities
on saturday and sunday bernstein canceled appearances with an orchestra of young musicians from the pacificasia region who had been training under principals of the lso during the threeweek pacific music festival in northern japan
bernstein inaugurated the festival last month
he started the event along the lines of the tanglewood music festival in massachusetts where young musicians train with the boston symphony orchestra
the japan festival is believed to be the first festival in asia where young musicians can train with a professional orchestra
krauts statement said it was not known whether bernstein would be able to conduct next month at the tanglewood festival or during the tanglewood music center orchestra tour in europe later this summer
free enterprise has collided with the academy awards and everybodys trying to pick up the pieces
with oscar statuettes selling at auction for more than  and a chicago trophy company casting alleged academy award clones the national academy of motion picture arts and sciences is scrambling to make sure oscars golden sheen isnt tarnished by hollywood hucksterism
if you know about an infringement and fail to object to it you risk having your trademark become public domain said bruce davis the academys executive administrator in explaining the lawsuits the organization has filed to protect its beloved hunk of electroplated pewter
but despite the academys crusade against crass commercialism this years awards ceremony will feature a new merchandising wrinkle some  limousines delivering the most famous stars to the oscar telecast will be equipped with doormounted coolers jammed with diet coke cocacola classic and other cocacola co beverages
when the limo doors swing open in front of the shrine auditorium and the celebrities tumble out the coke logo will be on display in front of an audience that includes millions around the world
it seemed like a good marketing opportunity said cocacola spokesman ira gleser
the academy approached our local bottler in los angeles and said were going to have a lot of thirsty people
but even as the academy embraces this new intrusion of merchandising it has lashed out at whatever else it considers a blemishing of the oscar name
when mgmua the distributor of rain man published newspaper advertisements touting the films oscar nominations before the nominations were even announced the academy issued a harsh statement condemning mgmuas promotional gamble
after the ads appeared rain man collected nine nominations
we regard this as a serious matter and we have communicated our concern said richard kahn president of the academy
for nearly  years the academy has maintained strict security around both the nominations and the award winners
it also has envisoned the statuette itself as something of an icon
so auctioning the oscar has greatly distressed the academy
the collectors book store local sponsors of monthly entertainment memorabilia auctions has sold off seven oscars in the past year including the best picture trophy for s an american in paris  marlon brandos best actor prize for s on the waterfront  and the black and white interior decoration oscar for s how green was my valley 
none were sold by the original recipients heirs or friends who had later received the trophies put them on the block
when malcolm willits the book stores owner announced that he would hold a february auction for the  bestpicture trophy for around the world in  days the academy said enough initiating a court action that for now has blocked any future trophy sales
the academy insists that a contract signed by oscar winners mandates that they will not sell the trophies without first offering them to the academy for a nominal fee
but now that the word is out that these awards are worth  to  people are reluctant to sell them back to the academy for  willits said
the academy has created something of great value here
this is the most famous award in the world  the most instantly recognizable award
the nobel prize might be a greater honor but people know more about what an academy award looks like
and theyre very limited too
theres not too many of them around
 twenty years ago you wouldnt have a movie poster in your living room unless you were a college student
now you can go into beverly hills homes and theres a movie poster and the darn things worth  or  dollars
when the academy won a court order temporarily blocking future auctions willits decided to sell his store
it seemed to be the final straw
i dont like lawsuits he said
im getting older and id like to write movie scripts
yet the academy has lost its most recent attempt to save its trophys integrity a copyright infringement suit brought against the houston international film festival was dismissed march  in a california federal court
the academy had claimed the lone star statuette designed and built by chicagos creative house promotions was practically identical to the oscar
the court found otherwise

the radio of kuwaits new iraqiinstalled government claimed that iraqi troops began pulling out of kuwait on sunday but the united states said it doubted a withdrawal was really under way
the radio announcement came three days after iraq invaded kuwait and one day after baghdad said it had replaced the oilrich kingdoms ousted monarchy with a new government made up of nine kuwaiti army offices
iraq also said saturday that it was creating a new kuwaiti army and that  iraqis the approximate number of soldiers baghdad took over kuwait with had volunteered for the new military force
in other developments the white house continued to seek the immediate and unconditional withdrawl of all iraqi troops and it thanked the many nations who have condemned the invasion and imposed economic sanctions on baghdad
after several days of debate japan on sunday banned all oil imports from iraq and kuwait and halted japanese exports to both countries
tokyo said it would suspend all loans to iraq and kuwait ban japanese investment there and freeze iraqi assets in japan
japan which imports  percent of its oil had relied on iraq and kuwait for more than  percent of its oil imports
the white house hailed japans move and said prime minister toshiki kaifu called president bush on sunday at camp david to inform him about the sanctions
although tens of thousands of iraqi troops reportedly remained massed near kuwaits border with saudi arabia washington said on sunday there was no indication that any soldiers had moved into saudi arabia
the white house said that  american oil workers rounded up after the invasion had been brought to baghdad talked with us embassy officials and were in good shape
it said that accounts for all missing americans
an unconfirmed report said a warplane from the deposed emirs air force in kuwait bombed an iraqi military headquarters near kuwait city
it was not clear where the plane came from or whether its reported attack caused any damage
the radio of kuwaits new government monitored in bahrain quoted its military correspondent as saying the pullout began at  am  am edt
iraqi president saddam hussein allowed reporters based in baghdad to be taken south to basra overnight to observe the first iraqi troops return home
but at the white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said on sunday morning we have no independent or confirmable information on this report of the withdrawl beginning
saddam husseins actions in the past have raised serious skepticism about his intentions
iraq declared earlier that the provisional government installed by baghdad is capable of ensuring security in the occupied country
baghdad television has said the new government is headed by col ala hussein ali and that he holds the positions of prime minister commanderinchief of the armed forces minister of defense and interior minister
the other eight members were lieutenant colonels and majors
but kuwaits embassy in amman jordan on sunday dismissed the new government as a list of fake names and said ali is saddams soninlaw
a similar report appeared in one of cairos leading newspapers alahram
it quoted the kuwait embassy in tunis which said that ali works with saddams administration in baghdad
the iraqi news agency carried a kuwaitdatelined statement it said was from the provisional government denying any of its members were iraqis
in jordan prime minister mudar badran said his nation will not recognize the new government because that would hinder arab efforts to end the conflict
us french and british warships meanwhile steamed toward the persian gulf
president bush said friday that if iraq moved against saudi arabia it would be attacking us vital interests
on saturday bush said in washington that the use of force in resolving the crisis remains an option
saudi arabia ships  million barrels of oil to the united states daily
fitzwater said on sunday that there was no indication iraqi forces had moved into saudi arabia even though tens of thousands of them have been reported to be within  to  miles of the saudi border
in washington iraqi ambassador mohammed almashat on saturday denied us and other foreign reports suggesting that iraq plans to invade saudi arabia
saddam ordered the invasion of kuwait after accusing it of stealing oil from a field that straddles their disputed border
he also blamed kuwait for a fall in oil prices that cost iraq  billion saying it contributed to the oil glut by cheating on its opec oil cartel production quotas
seven years late the hubble space telescope is where it belongs out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time
less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle discovery on tuesday the  billion telescope sent its first test radio signal
at the sign of life applause and cheers erupted in mission control in houston
as near as we can tell everything looks perfect said astronaut steve hawley from the shuttle
hawleys job on wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a year stay in space
discovery trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky carried the silvercolored telescope to an orbit  miles above earth  higher by  miles than any previous shuttle
there the hubble will stay to search for yetunseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look  billion years backward in time
our window on the universe
nasa launch commentator george diller exulted as the discovery rose off its seaside launch pad
its a beautiful day to have hubble space telescope in orbit instead of here on earth like its been for so many years said nasa administrator richard truly
hubbles in its element and im delighted
the telescope was supposed to be launched in  but technical problems and the challenger accident delayed its deployment
it suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the fourminutestogo point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle
while it remained on earth the telescope cost  million a month to exercise and keep in readiness
in its first day in space that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the goddard space flight center in maryland
on hand to watch the discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
truly referred to the earlyday astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station
somebody the other day said who remembers the day that galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars
said truly a former shuttle astronaut
it doesnt matter what day we launch hubble it matters that we do it right
the telescope is  feet long and  feet in diameter about the size of a railroad tank car
when it flies free it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays that extend outward on each side
it is named after the late astronomer edwin p hubble who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is the faster it is traveling
that gave support to the theory that a massive explosion  the big bang  created the universe  to  billion years ago
the hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions how old is the universe
how big is it
the telescope has two mirrors one  inches in diameter the other  inches
two of the instruments are cameras two are spectrometers and one is a photometer
in addition the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances
on wednesday hawley is to grapple the ton telescope with the shuttles mechanical arm lift it out of the cargo bay point it and  after a long checkout  drop it overboard to orbit on its own
in the cargo bay the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle
but the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun
should the solar panels not deploy mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan will be standing by partially dressed in space suits ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually
discoverys launch was not without its problems
with  seconds left in the countdown the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process
the problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at  am edt about three minutes late
the shuttle is scheduled to land sunday at  am edt at edwards air force base in california
on the way uphill as commander loren j shriver put it the shuttles windshield was splattered with several flecks of things
he said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit
the astronauts also had problems with their uhf radio circuit and one of the ships small rear thrusters was inoperative
neither problem was considered serious

karen moody vice president of the classical label would not reveal sales figures for the bernstein edition but said i can say that it is selling very well in this country surprisingly well given the us market aversion to cd sets
in los angeles carol brown west coast manager of sales and marketing for bmg classicsrca red seal told the times on thursday that her label now plans a march release of recordings by bernstein conducting the rca symphony in coplands billy the kid and a suite from bernsteins on the town recordings made in the s and representing the conductorcomposers first commercial recordings
bmg also plans according to spokesman carl pritzkat the spring release of an early bernstein recording as pianist  in which he plays coplands piano variations  as well as other recorded documents of the young composerpianist
the entire bernstein catalogue encompasses well over  classical recordings and occupies more than a full page in the schwann catalogue

a year campaign that has succeeded in getting northeastern university to award an honorary degree to jailed south african nationalist leader nelson mandela has raised objections from some faculty and students
northeastern announced plans to award the degree honoring mandela on may  ending a long effort by students seeking to change a university policy barring honorary degrees for anyone who could not be present at the ceremony
the degree is to be accepted by south african archbishop desmond tutu who is scheduled to be in boston for a benefit dinner
law students last september began a campaign of demonstrations and vigils on the campus
they hung a banner from the second floor of the law library that said honor nelson mandela
before he was imprisoned said thirdyear law student sarah ottinger nelson mandela was an  attorney and an activist who worked against apartheid
thats the message we wanted conveyed to students
south africas whiteminority government says it will free mandela only if he renounces the use of violence by forces seeking political power for blacks in the country
some faculty members and students including many blacks have criticized the administrations plan for the event saying no effort was made to include them
i dont even know what office is sponsoring it said keith motley dean and director of the africanamerican institute a student group
we got a memo from the administration saying they need six ushers but thats it
youd think at least wed be clued in to whats going on
this started out as something noble something weve tried to have done for three years said ottinger
we are very very sorry it happened this way
it wasnt meant to turn out like this
the trustees decided in january that mandela should get the honorary degree
students set up a committee to contact mandelas family to get their approval
university spokesman paul jones said letters were sent to mandelas wife winnie and his two daughters zenani a student at boston university and makaziwe a student at the university of massachusetts at boston
however northeastern still has not received approval from the mandela family the boston globe reported
sir nicholas lyell qc the attorneygeneral will attempt to stop the curtain rising on maxwell the musical the west end show chronicling the life and times of the late robert maxwell
fears that the musical might prejudice the criminal trial of the late publishers sons kevin and ian have prompted sir nicholas to apply to the high court on monday for an injunction to halt the production
the musical tells the tycoons life story through updated versions of familiar tunes from gilbert and sullivan
now in rehearsal the show is due to open at londons criterion theatre on february 
the attorneygenerals move to close down a west end production before its first night is regarded as without precedent
however it is no more unprecedented most lawyers say than the prospect of the maxwell brothers having to commute to their trial at the old bailey past a theatre advertising the story of their father as the musical review that will make you laugh sing  and be angry
the musical which has cost pounds m to put on has been produced by mr evan steadman a former chairman of one of maxwells private companies
mr steadman indicated yesterday he intended the show to go on and that the attorneygenerals application for an injunction would be contested
however he said he was leaving matters in the hands of his lawyers
press coverage of the late publisher since his death has already caused deep concern to the maxwell brothers lawyers 
mr alun jones qc kevin maxwells barrister led calls for reporting restrictions to be placed on a recent high court ruling that robert maxwell had been fraudulent in his dealings with shares in berlitz the publishing company
turning down his request the judge asked him is it going to be your clients defence that mr robert maxwell was not guilty of misappropriation
at that point lawyers in court themselves fell about laughing
an earthquake that devastated parts of nepal and india earlier this week has killed more than  people officials from the two countries said friday
mourners paraded through the streets of this medieval town calling for revenge after a former legislator was beaten to death by political rivals while he was distributing relief supplies to earthquake victims
hang the murderers scores of young men chanted as they marched in front of a jeep bearing the battered body of karna hyanju once a sympathizer of the nowoutlawed communist party
witnesses said hyanju was beaten with umbrellas and sticks late thursday afternoon then dragged through the streets for nearly two hours before police intervened
he died friday at the bir hospital in katmandu  miles west of bhaktapur
uttam dhaubanjar a yearold bank employee and neighbor of the dead man said hyanju had been handing out blankets milk and other food in bhaktapur when he was accosted by a group of men who accused him of giving relief supplies only to his own supporters
reports of damage and devastation continued to arrive from remote parts of nepal on friday and the home affairs ministry updated its confirmed death toll to 
in india the official count rose to 
but survivors the news media and opposition politicians say the toll could be as high as 
sundays earthquake registered  on the richter scale which records energy released by a tremor according to ground motion measured by a seismograph
a reading of  indicates the possibility of severe damage while  signifies a major quake
dhaubanjar said he saw about  people rounded up by police thursday night after hyanjus beating death
he said many belonged to the same communist faction that hyanju once supported
people started beating him with umbrellas dhaubanjar said
there were a lot of scratches on his body and a lot of blood
it looked like one ear was missing
then they made a necklace of their shoes by tying the laces together put it around his neck and pulled him through the streets
as hyanjus body was taken through the winding streets of bhaktapur a thcentury town of ancient hindu temples thousands of the towns  people jammed streets temple steps and the balconies of brick and mud houses
pashupati rana one of several cabinet ministers who marched in the funeral procession said several people were arrested in the killing including the mayor the deputy mayor and a member of the rashtriya panchayat or nonpartisan assembly
rana who is minister of local development and legislative affairs called hyanjus death political murder
hyanju served in the panchayat from  until  when he lost the backing of the communists in bhaktapur traditionally a leftist stronghold
the panchayat whose members are elected on nonparty lines was created after the late king mahendra abolished the old parliament and all political parties in  saying a westernstyle parliamentary system was not suited to his mountain kingdom
dhaubanjar and a group of young men who gathered around him said hyanju was perceived as a government supporter despite his previous communist leanings
the bodies of four moslems were found in a kashmir town monday five days after they were kidnapped by moslem militants agitating for secession from india
the bodies which had bullet wounds were found in the town of sopore about  miles northwest of the kashmir capital of srinagar said police officials speaking on condition of anonymity
anonymous callers to local newspapers and news agency offices said the four were killed by the hezbul mujahedeen because they were police informers
the hezbul mujahedeen is one of more than a dozen moslem organizations fighting for independence of the kashmir valley from india
police officials also reported the death of one soldier in a militant ambush of an army convoy in the district of baramulla northwest of srinagar
at least three soldiers were injured they said
the deaths raise to  the number of people killed since security forces began a crackdown on the moslem movement on jan 
the kashmir valley most of which falls in the indian state of jammukashmir is predominantly moslem
jammukashmir is the only indian state with a moslem majority
moslem militants earlier had demanded union with pakistan the islamic nation on indias western border
but of late they have been demanding independence and the status of a neutral nation
the experiment also hinted that the blood and urine test which measures the activity of a blood protein called renin might suggest a new risk factor for heart attacks
about half of the  million americans who suffer a heart attack each year dont have the known risk factors for heart disease such as high cholesterol levels cigarette smoking obesity and high blood pressure
it is unknown what distinguishes these seemingly healthy people from those who dont suffer heart attacks
the blood and urine test is already being done in many commercial laboratories but for medical conditions other than heart attack risk said john h laragh of the cardiovascular center at cornell university and new york hospital
in our hands it cost about  and in other labs it may cost the patient  to  he said
dr laragh pioneered the research underlying use of the test which was developed by his wife biochemist jean e sealey
the test which isnt patented is available in kit form to laboratories
the blood portion of the test determines whether the kidneys are releasing renin into the blood stream and how active the chemical is
the release of renin is the first step in a rapid chemical chain reaction that raises blood pressure
the urine portion of the test tells how much salt is in the bloodstream
a high concentration of salt in the blood also raises pressure
the test is based on the fact that if the salt concentration in the blood rises tending to boost blood pressure the activity of the renin normally drops to offset the effect of the salt
the new experiment was designed to test a theory put forth by dr laragh and his colleagues that the activity of the renin in the blood foretells a possible heart attack
the theory has provoked sometimes furious controversy for almost  years
the cornell cardiologist has argued that in many people with high blood pressure the activity of the renin in the blood is much higher than is warranted by the amount of salt in the blood
such high renin people are at a high risk of a heart attack
on the other hand in other patients with high blood pressure the activity of the renin is much lower than is warranted by the degree of salt in the blood
these low renin people are at a low risk of heart attack dr laragh has maintained
in the experiment blood and urine samples were obtained at new york city offices and factories from  workers found to have mild to moderate high blood pressure
the patients high blood pressure was initially discovered in a screening program carried out by michael h alderman and his colleagues at albert einstein college of medicine who operate a worksite blood pressure control program in cooperation with local unions
in  dr laraghs group began testing the renin activity in blood and urine samples collected by dr aldermans team
they kept track of the workers for more than eight years to see which had heart attacks
the results published in this weeks new england journal of medicine lend strong support to dr laraghs theory
only  of the patients had high renin profiles
but the seven heart attacks in this small group constituted the highest incidence of heart attacks among the patients  heart attacks per  personyears of observation
the incidence in the high renin patients was more than double the incidence in those with a normal renin profile   heart attacks per  personyears  and more than triple that of the patients with a low renin profile  per  personyears drs
alderman laragh and their respective colleagues reported
regardless of how the statisticians broke down the patients into various groups those with high renin profiles almost invariably had the highest incidence of heart attacks
smokers had more heart attacks than nonsmokers but the incidence of attacks in smokers with high renin profiles was more than six times that in smokers with low renin profiles
but the real dynamite is in the patients who didnt have any of the usual risk factors dr laragh said in an interview
among patients who had normal blood cholesterol level and were free of diabetes those with high renin profiles were seven times more likely to have a myocardial infarction heart attack than those with normal or low renin profiles the researchers wrote
there were no heart attacks among the  patients with low renin profiles who had no risk factors other than high blood pressure
to dr laragh this suggests that a high renin profile might signal a high risk of heart attack even for people without high blood pressure
we think everybody should have this simple and accurate test he said in the interview
its a new window into heart disease
in an accompanying editorial victor j dzau of stanford university medical school said the study shows that the renin profile test is potentially useful in identifying high blood pressure patients who are at risk of a heart attack
but he wrote a larger populationbased study will be important in confirming the results of this paper
the experiment has implications for drug makers as well as patients
apparently by coincidence abbott laboratories announced on tuesday that is developing a high blood pressure drug that works by inhibiting the activity of renin
other major drug makers are thought to also be working on renin inhibitors
the experiment hints these drugs might also protect patients from heart attacks
a bigselling class of high blood pressure drugs including bristolmyers squibb corps capoten and merck  cos vasotec are known as ace inhibitors because they work by stopping renin in the blood from being converted to a second chemical called angiotensin
studies are under way to see if these ace inhibitors protect patients against heart attacks as well as lower their blood pressure
the lens cover on the hubble space telescope opened today after a morning of worrisome problems and mission control told the discovery astronauts they no longer are needed to rescue the  billion instrument
youve been released from hubble support its on its own mission control told the astronauts when the aluminum aperture door opened
thank you sir thats great news said discovery commander loren j shriver
there are handshakes and smiles all around up here said steve hawley who had been at the controls when the telescope was released into its own orbit on wednesday
ill bet its just that way down there too
the successful opening of the lens cover paved the way for the astronauts to return to earth on sunday
they had blasted into space tuesday after a twoweek delay and dispatched the telescope from its payload bay wednesday
the hubble is open for business mission control told the astronauts
the telescope still was having problems however
when the door opened two of its four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working and the electronic system went into an automatic safe mode in which all motion is stopped
the team at the goddard space flight center in maryland which guides the telescope said the dooropening motion jarred the telescope more than had been expected and that the system reacted properly in shutting down
by early afternoon a stepbystep procedure was begun to bring the telescopes electronics back on line
steve terry a top hubble engineering official said tolerances for the telescope systems had been set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions
in addition to the trouble this morning there two communications outages thursday totaling several hours
were cautious and thats natural he said
weve got a very expensive spacecraft here and we dont want to do anything to jeopardize the usefulness
 well get to the point where we know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits appropriately
nasa announced that at this time the telescope is safe stable
the space shuttle discovery which carried the telescope to orbit was  miles behind the telescope ready to lend a hand if needed
later in the day the ship was to do an engine firing that would set it on a preliminary path for home
that path would take the discovery two miles below the telescope
the lens cover a foot diameter aperature door covers the opening to the telescopes light shield
when it is closed the telescope is blind
the lens cover had been closed  except for a tiny wedge opening  ever since the  billion telescope was dropped overboard by the discovery crew on wednesday
now that it is opened starlight can strike the lens for the first time and it can go about its business of photographing and analyzing the universe in ways and with sensitivity never before possible
the door is made from honeycombed aluminum sheets covered on the outside with solarreflecting material
the inside is painted black to absorb stray light
if the door opening command had failed the five discovery astronauts who deployed hubble were prepared to head back to the telescope
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan would have performed a space walk to open the door saturday if necessary
if it had been needed the rescue would have delayed the landing scheduled for sunday at edwards air force base calif by a day
the astronauts were awakened at  am edt to the mellow sounds of the beach boys song kokomo
for max qs keyboard thats the way that song should really be done mission control radioed to mission specialist steve hawley a member of the allastronaut band called max q
your next practice is sunday evening in the gym dont be late
max q is a nasa acronym for the point in the shuttles ascent when the aerodynamic pressure is at its greatest point
that sounds just like the way we do it replied hawley
if you get us home by sunday ill go to practice
in an orbit high enough to avoid earths distorting atmosphere hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billion years to reach earth
it is capable of detecting objects  times fainter and with  times greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory
during its year working lifetime hubble is expected to help determine the age and size of the universe
it may solve the mysteries of quasars pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life
on tuesday nasa plans to release its first test image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina
significant data will follow in a month or two
the ton footlong telescope about the size of a bus is named for astronomer edwin p hubble who died in 
the missouriborn hubble discovered during the s that the universe is expanding a finding that gave rise to the theory the universe was created about  billion years ago by a tremendous explosion
what do charlie chaplin greta garbo cary grant alfred hitchcock and steven spielberg have in common
they have never won academy awards for their individual achievements
such flagrant omissions are often cited by critics as evidence of the unfairness of hollywoods highest prize
oscars year history is filled with examples of the film worlds highest achievers being overlooked by the academy of motion picture arts and sciences
the latest casualties are directors james l brooks whose movie broadcast news was nominated though he wasnt and spielberg who was left out in the cold with his empire of the sun
although broadcast news won seven major nominations including best picture and three acting categories brooks was strangely overlooked by the academys directing branch
since no movie has ever won a best picture oscar without its director at least being nominated the chances of the oncefavored broadcast news to be a big winner at the awards ceremony on april  have been significantly reduced
brooks did better in  when his terms of endearment took the lions share of oscars including best picture and director
spielbergs empire of the sun won six nominations this year none of them major and none for director
two years ago the color purple received  nominations but not for him as director
the directors guild nevertheless named him best director that year
im floored by this spielberg said upon receiving his dga award
this is the last thing i expected to happen
if some of you are making a statement  thank god  i thank you for that
why the spielberg slight
some observers cite the fact that only  directors nominate for the academy awards and many are veterans who might not look kindly on the young man whose films are the biggest moneymakers in history jaws et raiders of the lost ark
the academy appeared to make amends last year by presenting spielberg with the irving thalberg award for consistently high quality of production
there was no mention of the fact that spielberg is primarily a director not a producer
the thalberg award has come in handy to acknowledge giants who were overlooked for individual awards
the recipients have included cecil b demille stanley kramer alfred hitchcock ingmar bergman and mervyn leroy
the honorary award has also proved useful to salve the academys conscience
charlie chaplin received one at the first academy awards for his creation of the circus and again at the th awards for the incalculable effect he has had in making motion pictures the art form of this century
douglas fairbanks judy garland noel coward ernst lubitsch fred astaire gene kelly harold lloyd greta garbo maurice chevalier stan laurel cary grant lillian gish edward g robinson groucho marx howard hawks and jean renoir are others who have received honorary awards
cary grant once remarked that he never expected to win an academy award
id have to blacken my teeth first he quipped alluding to the academys fondness for actors who portray bums and downtrodden characters
alfred hitchcock also had a lighthearted comment on why he failed to win an oscar i suppose it was a matter of carelessness
the overlooking of classic films and the industrys most talented filmmakers has provided historians with cause for dispute
for example citizen kane which customarily places no
 on polls of the greatest american films was nominated in  for best picture there were  nominees in those days for orson welles performance direction and coscripting with herman mankiewicz gregg tolands camera work plus art direction sound music and editing
the only oscar for citizen kane was for the script
how green was my valley was named best picture
billy wilders classic comedy some like it hot failed to be nominated as best picture as did chaplins modern times hawks red river and woody allens manhattan
oh well
oscar might use joe e browns final line from some like it hot nobodys perfect
investigators aboard the uss iowa searched for clues to the cause of a fiery explosion that claimed the lives of  sailors as the damaged battleship headed home and griefstricken families dealt with the loss of their loved ones
officials refused to speculate publicly on what caused the worst disaster to strike a navy ship in more than a decade a blast that ripped through the iowas no
 gun turret during naval exercises wednesday in the atlantic north of puerto rico
although naval gunnery experts combed the vessel thursday their task was complicated by the absence of survivors from the swiveling gun housing where the explosion occurred
eleven men escaped from powder magazines located deep within the ship at the base of the turret
we have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired defense secretary dick cheney told reporters as he returned to washington from a nato meeting in brussels
the navy imposed a moratorium on firing inch guns found on the iowa and its three sister battleships the new jersey the wisconsin and the missouri pending an investigation of the disaster
adm richard d milligan a former commander of the new jersey began the board of inquirys investigation and pentagon spokesman fred hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would be completed
as the iowa headed toward its home port in norfolk va the flagdraped metal coffins containing the bodies of the  seamen killed arrived at the dover air force base in delaware site of the largest military mortuary
navy honor guards carried the coffins off a camouflaged c galaxy cargo plane
the bodies had been airlifted by helicopter from the iowa while it was anchored offshore from roosevelt roads naval station in puerto rico and placed on the cargo plane for the flight home
across the nation teams of navy officers and chaplains broke the news to the sailors next of kin
its the greatest tragedy any of us can suffer said rear adm jimmy pappas the base commander in norfolk
its the most difficult thing you have to do to tell someone that a loved one has been killed
ernest hanyecz sr of bordentown nj stayed up all night trying to get information about his yearold son ernest before learning thursday that he was among those killed
as long as they play their war games there will be more deaths and innocent people will die said hanyecz whose son joined the navy at the age of 
the dead included one officer lt jg
phillip edward buch  of las cruces nm and  enlisted men
most victims were single and from  to  years old said navy officials
a memorial service will be held monday on the norfolk base
adm jerome johnson the commander of the us nd fleet who was aboard the iowa said the fire and explosion was instantaneous
navy officials aboard the iowa had scheduled firing  rounds
four rounds were fired from the no
 turret and immediately after the commander had given the order to load and prepare the gun in the no
 turret the explosion occurred
capt
larry seaquist a former captain of the iowa told reporters earlier in the day it seems from the reports that those powders exploded
six pound sacks of powder are rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a pound shell
naval officers familiar with the iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked but seaquist stressed we simply do not know what caused that powder to go
none of the four battleships of the iowa class which saw service in world war ii and the korean and vietnam wars had previously experienced such an explosion pentagon officials said
wednesdays explosion brought the worst loss of life for the navy since a  accident off spain in which  sailors died when a launch returning them to the uss guam and the uss trenton was struck by a spanish freighter
except for two world war ii japanese battleships and the current navy aircraft carriers the ton ships of the iowa class are the largest warships in the world
the earthquake that devastated iran early thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains an earthquake expert said
most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you said russ needham a geophysist with the us geological survey that monitors ground motion around the world
the quake hit at  am in iran when most of the people were in their homes needham said thursday in a telephone interview from golden colo at least  people died and thousands were injured in the quake which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes iranian officials said
needham said most structures in that area are built of a ceramictype brick or adobe that collapses easily
its very similar to what we had in armenia he said of the dec   earthquake that killed about  people
a soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings
the armenian quake was measured at  on the richter scale but thursdays earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 
the shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse he said
the magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area where two major plates of the earths crust meet needhams said
iran is in a very active seismic region he said and that there have been many smaller quakes
twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude  have occurred in iran during the last  years needhams said
a quake of magnitude  is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage in populated areas

checkpoint charlie the berlin wall border post that symbolized the cold war was hoisted into history today
as a brass band played and foreign ministers of the four world war ii allies watched a crane lifted the prefabricated hut with its american british and french flags and placed it on a flatbed truck to be taken to a museum
checkpoint charlie went up in  in the middle of the friedrichstrasse boulevard after communist east germany erected the berlin wall to choke off a flood of refugees to the enclave of west berlin
the checkpoint symbolized our conviction as allies that berlin should remain one city and travel within it should be free british foreign secretary douglas hurd said in a speech
we always hoped that one day checkpoint charlie would no longer be needed and now that day has arrived
at long last we are bringing charlie in from the cold he added
soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze attended the ceremony in a gesture of reconciliation with the western members of the wartime alliance britain france and the united states
shevardnadze the first soviet foreign minister to visit west berlin noted that the checkpoint was vanishing on the th anniversary of the nazi invasion of the soviet union
the closing of this checkpoint offers further proof of a turn for the better in the international arena for overcoming the legacy of confrontation he said
foreign ministers hansdietrich genscher of west germany and markus meckel of east germany also attended the ceremony
genscher thanked moscow for reform policies that had ended a time of trouble in berlin and opened the door to unity
hundreds of excited berliners leaned from balconies and windows today to cheer charlies exit snapping pictures and clapping in rhythm with the band as the crane pried the hut from its moorings and swung it away
former west german chancellor willy brandt who emotionally challenged the building of the wall as mayor of west berlin in the early s was in the front row of an invited audience
afterward souvenir hunters ran up and snatched cobblestones that had served as checkpoint charlies foundation

laughter and tears flowed freely as the broadway theatrical community said goodby thursday to leonard bernstein at the majestic theater
longtime friends and colleagues  those who knew him as lenny  paid tribute to the musicaltheater dynamo with heartfelt and humorous words and often in song
the capacity audience  invited friends relatives and theatrical personalities as well as  members of the public who started lining up at  am  heard recollections of an energetic bernstein who danced until dawn in discos as well as a poignant account of his final days
arthur laurents who wrote the book for west side story hosted the minute tribute to bernstein  who died oct 
wherever lenny was was theater his every move was a stage direction he said as many in the audience laughed knowingly
another west side story collaborator directorchoreographer jerome robbins had earned a laugh before he even spoke thanks to laurents introductory words fearless as lenny was there were two figures he did fear  god and jerome robbins
after noting that he wished he were young enough to pay homage to bernstein by performing the sailors variation he created in the ballet fancy free robbins  recalled that halcyon  collaboration between the two yearolds
he also reflected on the joyous nature of their  west side story collaboration even while the show faced repeated obstacles before reaching broadway
lennys music was the lifeblood of that show
his theater scores werent just a collection of songs but were more like a symphonic work noted robbins who also collaborated on several other ballet and theater works with bernstein
he concluded in subdued tones we have lost a maker and shaker of our century
a light went out for me
carol lawrence the original maria of west side story sang a medley of i feel pretty and tonight
the west side story reunion was not as complete as had been scheduled larry kert was unable to be there and stephen sondheim who then a newcomer to broadway wrote the lyrics could not attend due to illness in his family
original cast members from bernstein shows sang numbers they had helped launch into history
nancy walker sang her sassy i can cook too from on the town
her fellow cast members betty comden and adolph green who also teamed with bernstein as the shows creators after fondly recalling their year friendship with bernstein poignantly sang the shows bittersweet finale some other time
barbara cook the original cunegonde in bernsteins candide  displayed her stillgleaming voice in a simple song from bernsteins  mass
candide itself was represented by glitter and be gay the coloratura aria cook made famous as performed by constance haumann
winging in from the west coast as was walker was lauren bacall who teamed up with phyllis newman for a sly rendition of ohio from bernsteins wonderful town
kurt ollmann familiar from bernsteins  west side story recording sang take care of this house from bernsteins last  unsuccessful broadway show  pennsylvania ave  a work the composer often spoke of wanting to revise
bernsteins son alexander delivered a funny knowing affectionate talk about his fathers unappreciated skills as an actor singer and dancer as only a family member could know them
michael wager a very close friend of bernsteins who was with him at the end spoke movingly of how difficult it was for bernstein to continue when illness had robbed him of his creative energy
marilyn horne closed the program with somewhere the emotional anthem from west side story after which laurents directed the audiences attention to the large photo that hung over the stage an exuberant yearold bernstein nearly levitating outside the theater where west side story had opened in washington
since lenny didnt like silence laurents asked instead for a final round of applause for the man who inspired and moved so many people for so many years
the audience responded with a sustained standing ovation
world leaders from president bush to president mikhail s gorbachev today praised andrei d sakharov as a tremendous force for freedom who outlived his soviet persecutors and saw the liberty he championed take root throughout eastern europe
the yearold scientist and human rights activist died thursday of an apparent heart attack in his moscow apartment
the soviet congress stood for a minute of silence for their colleague once considered a national hero for discovering the soviet hydrogen bomb but later reviled by kremlin leadership for his uncompromising stands for human freedom
gorbachev who freed the physicist from seven years of internal exile called sakharov a man of conviction and sincerity
its a great loss gorbachev said
he was a person who had his own ideas his own convictions which he expressed openly and directly
this doesnt mean i agreed with him although on many things we did agree
one soviet lawmaker called sakharov a man such as maybe appears once in a hundred years
bush said that all of us are diminished and that sakharov embodied all of what is good and decent in the human spirit
bush in a message of condolence to sakharovs widow yelena bonner said all of us who knew him will never forget his courage and devotion to freedom
just as he truly enriched all of us with his life all of us are diminished by his untimely death
aase lionaes chairman of the norwegian nobel committee that awarded sakharov the peace prize in  said he fell in the struggle for democratic reforms
his death represents a great loss especially at a time with hopes of a positive development in the soviet union and in all eastern europe
political leaders worldwide commended sakharov as a man whose causes went beyond ideology
lech walesa a fellow nobel peace prize laureate said sakharovs death was a great loss for reform both in the soviet union and everywhere else
he was just a remarkable person said british prime minister margaret thatcher
he was one of those who would always say the truth must be found and was never afraid of stating that and letting everyone know
it is just sad he will not be preeminent in the freer future of the soviet union she told reporters in london
in strasbourg france the member european parliament unanimously paid tribute to sakharov whose name it had given to its human rights prize
in brussels the nato foreign ministers hailed sakharov as a pioneer who helped change soviet society
nato secretary general manfred woerner said the ministers expressed deeply felt sense of loss at the passing of andrei sakharov
walmart a history of sam waltons retail phenomenon by sandra s vance and roy v scott twayne publishers new york dollars   pages many people might be said to be the personification of the american dream few are better qualified for that title than sam walton
walton is a character it would be difficult to invent an allamerican boy who became one of the worlds most successful businessmen
the churchgoing son of a farmer born in  near kingfisher oklahoma he founded a store chain which made him americas richest man and which shortly before his death in  became the worlds biggest retailer
his company walmart made sales of dollars bn last year and after waltons death fortune magazine reported that his wife and four children held between them the secondlargest fortune in the world  dollars bn
what is most startling about walmart is the speed of its growth
although walton built up a small chain of ben franklin variety store franchises from  it was not until  that he opened his first walmart discount store
at the time of its incorporation in  walmart had only  outlets with sales of dollars m  not enough to earn a place in trade journal discount merchandisers list of the  biggest us discount retailers
ten years later with  stores and dollars bn sales it was only the rdbiggest retailer in the us
its turnover was only  per cent of that of sears roebuck the biggest and  per cent of k mart the secondbiggest
within another  years walmart had overtaken them both
apart from waltons autobiography completed shortly before his death however published material about the company is curiously scarce
this book attempts to fill the gap to provide a scholarly account of the rise of walmart setting it in the wider context of us retailing and explaining how it was achieved
one strength the authors identify is walmarts ability to copy and adapt from other retailers
sam walton did not invent discount retailing
rather he realised the threat discounting posed to his own variety store business and studied in depth many of the uss leading discounters of the early s including ann and hope e j korvette spartans fedmart and k mart
walton learned from them all but was unique in taking his discount stores into small towns of a few thousand people where shoppers used to travelling long distances were delighted to have a cutprice store nearby selling everything they needed
another strength is walmarts openness to technology
as early as the s walton realised he was wasting too much time travelling and bought a small aircraft to pilot between stores himself  something he continued to do to the end of his life
sometimes walton was more reluctant to invest in technology and had to be persuaded by colleagues to introduce computers and scanning at checkouts  long before most retailers had recognised their importance  and to invest dollars m in an internal satellite communications system
this technology helped walmart build one of the most efficient distribution systems of any retailer
but perhaps the most fundamental reason for its success the book suggests has been walmarts streamlined and highly responsive management structure
regional vicepresidents based at group headquarters in bentonville arkansas rather than in costly regional offices are despatched every monday by aircraft to their regions spend the week visiting stores working with staff and managers and return for a daylong merchandising meeting every friday
they discuss results problems and suggestions from the week at a am meeting on saturdays and immediately afterwards call district managers to relate the results
district managers hold a conference call with their store managers and before the day is out the contents of the meeting have been communicated to all store department heads
the system means employees can make suggestions to vicepresidents one week and if the idea is accepted by the saturday meeting see its implementation begin the following week
even the worlds most successful retailer makes mistakes however
one was waltons decision to stand down from the chairman and chief executives role in  in favour of ronald mayer only to return to both roles in  after finding he was incapable of letting go of the reins
another was walmarts shortlived hypermart format which proved too big even for gigantist america
then there was waltons rash promise to do a hula dance on wall street if walmart achieved an  per cent pretax profit margin in 
the book also covers well the debate over whether walmarts impact on the economies of small us towns was positive or negative
if there are criticisms these are that this scholarly account never quite captures the sheer excitement of working in the worlds fastestgrowing retailer
moreover it makes little attempt to predict whether walmart can continue its growth and conquer the rest of the world in the way it conquered the us
but this is a wellresearched and accessible account of one mans success in building his own american dream

insurers face the prospect of paying out billions of dollars for damages caused by this weeks california earthquake
getting a grip on the extent of the damages is proving a far more difficult task than what insurers faced after hurricane hugo ripped through the caribbean and the carolinas last month
the earthquakes toll including possible deep structural damage goes far beyond the more easily observed damage from a hurricane says george reider a vice president in aetna life  casualty insurance cos claims division
but investors are betting that the financial and psychological impact of the earthquake coming so soon after the hurricane will help stem more than two years of intense pricecutting wars among business insurers
reflecting that logic insurancecompany stocks posted strong gains
aetna and other insurers are hiring engineers and architects to help them assess structural damage
most insurers already have mobilized their catastrophe teams to begin processing claims from their policyholders in northern california
since commercial air travel is interrupted aetna based in hartford conn chartered three planes to fly claims adjusters into sacramento and then planned for them to drive to the bay area
about  adjusters were dispatched yesterday afternoon along with laptop computers cellular phones and blank checks
some adjusters already in other parts of california drove to the disaster area with recreational vehicles and mobile homes that could be used as makeshift claimsprocessing centers
insurers will be advertising  numbers  probably on the radio  that policyholders can call to get assistance on how to submit claims
state farm mutual automobile insurance co the largest home and auto insurer in california believes the losses from the earthquake could be somewhat less than the  million in damages it expects to pay out for claims resulting from hurricane hugo
state farm based in bloomington ind is also the largest writer of personalproperty earthquake insurance in california
earthquake insurance is sold as a separate policy or a specific endorsement rider on a homeowners policy in california because of the areas vulnerability to earthquakes
state farm said about  of its policyholders in california have also purchased earthquake insurance
allstate insurance co a unit of sears roebuck  co said about  of its personal property policyholders  about  in the san franciso area  also have earthquake coverage
the association of california insurance companies estimated damage to residential property could total  million but only  million to  million is insured it said
officials from the american insurance associations propertyclaim service division which coordinates the efforts of the claims adjusters in an area after a natural disaster will be flying to san francisco today
they expect to have a preliminary estimate of the damages in a day or two
roads and bridges in the bay area appear to have suffered some of the most costly damage
highways such as the section of interstate  that collapsed in oakland generally dont have insurance coverage
industry officials say the bay bridge  unlike some bridges  has no earthquake coverage either so the cost of repairing it probably would have to be paid out of state general operating funds
however the bridge which charges a  toll each way does have loss of income insurance to replace lost revenue if the operation of the bridge is interrupted for more than seven days
that coverage is provided by a syndicate of insurance companies including firemans fund corp based in novato calif and cigna corp based in philadelphia
earthquakerelated claims arent expected to cause significant financial problems for the insurance industry as a whole
instead even with the liabilities of two natural disasters in recent weeks analysts said the total capital of the industry is likely to be higher at year end than it was at midyear
indeed the earthquake could contribute to a turnaround in the insurance cycle in a couple of ways
for example insurers may seek to limit their future exposure to catastrophes by increasing the amount of reinsurance they buy
such increased demand for reinsurance along with the losses the reinsurers will bear from these two disasters are likely to spur increases in reinsurance prices that will later be translated into an overall price rise
reinsurance is protection taken out by the insurance firms themselves
we are saying this is the breaking point this is the event that will change the psychology of the marketplace said william yankus an analyst with conning  co a hartford firm that specializes in the insurance industry
his firm along with some others issued new buy recommendations on insurer stocks yesterday
among the insurance stocks big gainers included american international group up  to  general re corp up  to  aetna up  to  and marsh  mclennan inc up  to 
still a few individual companies most likely smaller ones could be devastated
i think there is a damned good chance someone is going to hit the skids on this said oppenheimer  co analyst myron picoult
he suspects some insurers who had purchased reinsurance to limit their exposure to catastrophes will discover that reinsurance was used up by hurricane hugo
british west german scandinavian and other overseas insurers are bracing for big claims from the san francisco earthquake disaster
although its unclear how much exposure the london market will face uk underwriters traditionally have a large reinsurance exposure to us catastrophe coverage
jack byrne chairman of firemans fund said this disaster will test the catastrophe reinsurance market causing these rates to soar
the catastrophe losses sustained by insurers this year will probably be the worst on an inflationadjusted basis since   when another earthquake sparked the great san francisco fire
orin kramer an insurance consultant in new york estimates that the  san francisco destruction on an inflationadjusted basis included insured losses of  billion
he is estimating this weeks disaster will generate insured losses of  billion to  billion following about  billion in costs to insurers from hurricane hugo
the storey jijobhoy towers home of the bombay stock exchange was rocked by two powerful bombs last friday leaving  dead and  injured
the market reopened on monday in an attempt to return to normal
it has had to compromise  trading has been restricted to an hour a day and dealing has moved back to the traditional ring where it stopped a year ago
dealers seemed to like this the bse index rising by  per cent on monday and tuesday
but another bomb blast in calcutta triggered nervous selling yesterday and the index came back by  or  per cent to 
all this has taken place against a volatile background the bombay equity market over the past six weeks or so has had to contend first with unusually bullish speculation before the national budget on february  and subsequently with some savage expressions of disappointment
dr manmohan singh the indian finance minister disappointed traders in the budget at the end of last month
he postponed corporate tax reforms by a year denying hopes of a tax cut recommended by an expert group
he did reduce excise and import duties on a broad front but left out the cement and steel sectors where share prices had been boosted by prebudget speculation
to top it all dr singh refused to equate domestic investors with their overseas counterparts in taxing shortterm capital gains
he lowered the tax to  per cent from  per cent for expatriate indians and foreign investors but for local investors it remained at  per cent
taking the tax concessions for granted traders had driven up share prices in february to make a kill later
instead the budget turned out to be a nightmare
while industry and business welcomed the statement which for once did not propose any new tax professor rusi taraporewala the stock market theorist and academic said a reduction in import duties would leave corporate profits exgrowth this year
the relative lack of financial concessions meant that disappointed traders sold with a vengeance and until the weekend the market seemed bottomless as equity prices plummeted to a month low
overseas investors fuelled the downtrend as they sold some half a million shares of reliance industries arbitraging between the share price on the bombay stock exchange and the market price of its euroissue of global depository receipts gdrs
the opportunity arose after a change in indian regulations which allows international investors to convert gdrs into the underlying stock
at the current conversion rate of rs per us dollar the reliance gdr fetched rs per share against the bse quotation of rs
the bse share index plunged by more than onefifth to  on march  from  at the postbudget trading session on february 
share prices rebounded last week taking the index to  and the uptrend on balance has continued this week in spite of the bomb blast on friday
whether or not the surge will turn into a strong rally will depend on the ability of bulls to maintain their momentum
they are hoping that foreign portfolio investment will pick up with the restoration of trading after black friday and the successful sale of reliance stock on the bse by international investors
the indian stock markets have been passing through a series of crises since december when activists of the bhartiya janta party pulled down the babri mosque at ayodhya sparking off communal riots
mr mark bulloch of jardine fleming takes the domestic political situation in his stride
nothing dramatic has happened as far as foreign investors are concerned he says
they are appraising the political situation
in the meantime there is no compulsion for local investors to sell
in this they are more fortunate than they were in previous years when they were under pressure to take advantage of a longterm capital gains tax exemption before the financial year ended in march
the exemption has been replaced by a flat  per cent tax this year which according to dealers puts bulls and bears on an even footing
the two dominant home and automobile insurers in the carolinas said tuesday that they expect to be hit with about  million in claims from hurricane hugo
such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry
state farm insurance co expects claims as high as  million in south carolina where it insures one out of every five homes spokesman jerry parsons said
the bloomington illbased company is also projecting an additional  million in claims from storm damage in north carolina and virginia he said
additionally nationwide insurance co said it expects claims close to  million more than triple the  million that the company paid for damages caused by hurricane elena when it swept through florida alabama and mississippi in 
our previous alltime high was in  when we paid  million in comparable claims for hurricane alicia which struck galveston and houston
there were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm but there was not the severity of damage as in hugo parsons said
officials said property damage from hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on charleston and then instead of heading out to sea veered northwest hitting other population centers including charlotte nc losses still being tallied nationwide based in columbus ohio is the biggest home and auto insurance in north carolina where damage was unexpectedly high and is the thirdlargest insurer in south carolina
we have so far received  claims spokesman bob sohozich said
although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record  million in claims paid by the industry after hurricane frederic struck mississippi and alabama in  parsons said
the insurance information institute is expected to issue a report thursday on overall insured losses from hugo
although the losses are substantial they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs
for example nationwide said it would be responsible for up to  million in claims while its reinsurers would cover up to  million in damages
reinsurers  which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income  typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies
analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies which are owned by policyholders but they noted that losses from hurricane hugo would also affect the shortterm earnings of some publicly traded companies
continental corp said it expects to report a pretax charge of  million for the third quarter reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm
the new yorkbased company had substantial business in puerto rico and the virgin islands where hugo first struck with devastating force
forecasts may be cut the charge might push continental into the red for the quarter said udayan ghose an analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york
if there is a profit it will be a very small one he said
the charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to  he added
ghose said shearson may also cut its thirdquarter and annual earnings projections for cigna corp usfg corp and lincoln national corp which are expected to suffer hurricanerelated losses equal to about  of expected fullyear earnings
overall  catastrophic losses for the industry now total about  billion and analysts expect hugo to make this year the costliest
but this could be a positive for the industry ghose said explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized
billions of dollars in losses from hugo and other catastrophes this year would have a significant impact on excess capital he said causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly
that would be good for the companies and shareholders he said
the mass emigration of thousands of disaffected east germans has rekindled reunification talk in west germany where some legislators plan to begin exploring the possiblity of reuniting the two germanys
no one is predicting a date for a possible reunification
proponents acknowledge the risks of assuming too much of east bloc reform trends and most hedge their thoughts with careful references to washington and moscow
yet growing signs of ferment in east germany have given chancellor helmut kohls government reason to consider the possibilities
eduard lintner parliamentary speaker on german affairs for the joint christian democrat and christrian socialist caucus in the bundestag said his committee has placed reunification on its october agenda
he said the sessions which will include government officials and outside experts hopefully can devise reunification models to discuss with west germanys western allies particularly the us it has become clear to the world that the communist system in east germany is in trouble mr lintner said
the time has come for us to show our allies but also reformminded people in the east that german reunification is no longer just a theory but a subject requiring a serious appraisal of how it could come about
there are still a number of imponderables mr linter conceded
for instance we want the federal government to approach our allies and get their thoughts on the reunification topic
the us ambassador to bonn vernon a walters earlier this month reaffirmed washingtons policy of supporting a german reunification based on free democratic elections
but mr walters caused a stir by predicting that reunion could occur in the relatively near future
emerging opposition to uncompromising communist rule in east germany has raised questions on how long east berlins leaders can resist the democratic reforms sweeping through neighboring east bloc countries
reforms in poland hungary and even the soviet union have magnified east germanys stalinist controls
fledgling protest groups and the influential protestant church have begun pressing for reforms in east germany which if allowed to include free elections could eventually lead to a reunited germany according to some western experts
dorothee wilms bonns cabinet minister for intergerman affairs said in an interview in the newspaper welt am sonntag that recent polls show that between  and  of all west germans favor a reunifed germany
the desire for reunification a feeling of togetherness a sense of nationhood  all this has strongly increased in recent years ms wilms told the newspaper
the recent escape movement from the ddr makes especially clear that people of both german states want to live free amongst themselves she said but cautioned that reunification cannot occur overnight
the first step she added is the reform process in the ddr
most west german governments since  have paid only lip service to the reunification goal set down in the preamble of west germanys constitution
political realities have prevented the topic from becoming a serious issue
analysts say that four decades of different systems would make reunification difficult
further many west german workers worry that a mass influx of east germans could threaten their jobs
thousands of east germans have emigrated to west germany over the austrohungarian border since budapest ignored east berlins protests and opened its border
close to  east german refugees have arrived in west germany so far this year either legally or by escaping and a total of more than  are expected by december
the soviets have joined east berlin in criticizing bonn for welcoming the east german refugees and chided hungary for violating an emigration treaty with east germany by allowing them to leave
moscow which has tolerated reforms elsewhere in the east bloc is said to be concerned by conditions in east germany perhaps the most important of its warsaw pact satellites
unconfirmed west german intelligence reports appearing in the west german media said moscow fears a growing dissident movement and mass demonstrations in east germany by next year
soviet president mikhail gorbachev accepted an invitation to attend east germanys th anniversary celebration providing an opportunity for serious discussions with erich honecker east berlins ailing party leader
east germanys communist leadership commented the newspaper frankfurter allgemeine zeitung has no illusions as to why gorbachev is honoring their th anniversary
he certainly will not say well done keep it up
the concept of a reunified germany enjoys support from the united states and other countries but some analysts believe the consequences of a political and economic german superstate could have an unsettling effect throughout europe
the lifting of travel restrictions by east germany on thursday has breathed new life into the idea of a single german state drawing expressions of support from the bush administration and others
but soviet affairs expert william hyland says that despite these assertions a reunified germany is really terrifying to most of the countries involved to the west germans to the united states soviet union poland and czechoslovakia
no one really wants german unity except the east german people and they turn out to be the decisive factor says hyland a onetime top aide to former secretary of state henry a kissinger
it was just  months ago when ceremonies were held commemorating the th anniversary of the start of world war ii a time when a unified germany initiated what was to become the slaughter of more than  million people
while a recurrence of that nightmare seems remote at best under any scenario an undivided germany could become the unchallenged economic and political force on the continent
the official us policy on the reunification question was outlined last thursday by state department deputy spokesman richard boucher
reunification has been supported by nato and by the united states for  years and our strongly held view is that reunification or reconciliation between the peoples of germany must take place in peace and freedom he said
as former national security adviser zbigniew brzezinski sees it the reunification issue will become very very active if a freely elected government takes power in east germany
that possibility has been mentioned by east german leaders as part of the ongoing reform process
brzezinski asks how do we arrange for the unification of germany so that it doesnt become destabilizing so it isnt a threat to germanys neighbors  france poland czechoslovakia
these are the issues we really have to very hard think about
we have to think of a new structure between nato and the warsaw pact
that is our new agenda
theodore sorenson a top aide to president john f kennedy when the berlin wall was built in  says he hopes a reunited germany will be forged as part of a reunited europe
reunification sorenson says will pose problems because we couldnt afford to have a reunited germany outside the western alliance
the soviet union couldnt afford to have a reunited germany as part of the western alliance
thats why i hope it will be a reunited europe within which the reunited germany can take place sorenson says
bernard rogers a former commander of allied forces in europe does not think reunification is inevitable
some form of federation he believes is more likely
rogers notes that soviet president mikhail gorbachev has said the nations of eastern europe can do what they want so long as they stay in the warsaw pact
if east germany stays in the warsaw pact nato with the best of its ability would try to prevent full reunification maybe a confederation between the two germanys but not a full reunification rogers says
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine points out that german reunification is a sensitive question for the soviets
soviet policy is based upon preventing a reunified economically strong and certainly militarily strong germany mitchell says
there must be some serious apprehension in the soviet union today because the events of the last couple of days certainly has made reunification more likely
the bush administration says it does not foresee the dismantling of nato under any circumstances but according to hyland the reunification of germany could mean the demise of the alliance
it may also mean the end of western european unity because both have been based on a divided germany and a divided europe hyland says
if that comes to an end and  million germans are united in a confederation or a single state it changes the entire map of europe
it changes all of the geopolitics and in effect ends the period weve been in since  the beginning of the war
iraq struck back against the west today rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in kuwait as the un security council overwhelming approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against iraq to punish it for invading the emirate
the iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of westerners based in kuwait or caught by the invasion
more than  million foreigners live and work in kuwait
several hundred britons americans and west germans were grabbed in the hotels and some were taken to iraq the west german and british foreign ministries said
britain said baghdad had given no reason for detaining  people most of them passengers from a british airways flight stranded at kuwait airport by the invasion
the un sanctions which included a ban on oil purchases came on a vote of  to  on the member council
cuba and yemen abstained on the resolution which was proposed by the united states
the iraqiinstalled kuwait government had earlier warned foreign countries that they should not forget their citizens in kuwait while heaping on economic punishments and todays roundup appeared to be a reaction against the sanctions
iraqi troops rolled into its new jerseysized neighbor thursday conquering the capital and moving south toward the saudi arabian border
persian gulf oil sources said today that they had seen saudi troops moving north toward the kuwaiti frontier near the oil port of khafji but the saudis denied that they had sent reinforcements to the border
iraqi authorities today told turkeys staterun pipeline company that one of the twin pipelines that carry baghdads oil through turkey will be closed for reasons of marketing officials said
world oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as more countries joined the attempt to strangle baghdads economy and force it to withdraw its invasion troops
iraqs oil revenues totaled more than  billion last year
it has been pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the  war with iran and settle foreign debts of up to  billion
one of the reasons iraq gave for invading kuwait was kuwaiti reluctance to slow its flow of oil and push oil prices higher but it was iraqi oil that had slowed today
there are very few tankers loading iraqi oil at yumurtalik a senior turkish government official said referring to the export jetties on the turkish side of the mediterranean sea
in baghdad president saddam hussein ordered drills for millions of people in case mass evacuations were needed
he warned his nations  million people to be on alert for possible us or israeli attacks
the united states has warned iraq against any attack on saudi arabia and president bush has said all options are open for the united states
hundreds of kuwaitis took to the desert to flee into saudi arabia their children and a few belongings crammed into fourwheeldrive vehicles

public interest in the earths troubled climate may be washed away with the heavy rains that are needed to end the current us drought weather experts warned during a drought symposium here
society tends to flit from hysteria to hysteria said pat michaels virginias state climatologist and moderator of the symposium
he said the  drought although not as dry as a  drought in many places has drawn much attention because some of the affected areas include large media centers
im worried  that when the next drought happens we are going to have to rediscover the climate problem said michaels president of the association of state climatologists
experts said thursday that the greenhouse effect  the warming of the earths atmosphere  has brought needed attention to changes in the global climate even though it is not directly related to the drought
many of the  climatologists and meterologists at the symposium agreed that the earths temperature is warming but they debated whether it is a short or longterm phenomenon and its impact on earth
however alan hecht director of the national climate program in washington dc said the uncertainty means policymakers should begin to deal with the possible effects especially undertaking policies that make sense in their own right
mankind must reduce reliance on fossil fuels he said by becoming more energy efficient replanting forests and investigating alternative energy supplies
scientists have warned in recent years that earths atmosphere is gaining in carbon dioxide and other gases which trap heat and cause the overall temperature to rise
besides fossil fuels the depletion of forests in south america has been blamed for the increase of carbon dioxide and methane
some have warned that higher temperature will change the character of many countries for example drying out the us midwest or melting polar ice caps
the symposium was sponsored by the weather channel an atlantabased cable network which broadcast the meeting live
earlier thursday the climatologists were told the movement of planets and the moon and sunspots may help lead to drought in the southeast
there is some evidence that as jupiter goes around the sun at its fastest point there are drought conditions in the southeast in the months of april and october georgia state climatologist gayther plummer said
however david rodenhuis director of the federal climate analysis center in washington said he was skeptical of plummers thesis
theres an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase rodenhuis said
the next business of the scientist is to  extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect
say what you want about albert goldman the author of the new biography the lives of john lennon morrow  but youve got to hand it to him this guy is one ambitious sleazemonger
most bestselling pop biographers play it safe they choose a celeb of respectable not to say pristine reputation and then they proceed to blacken it preferably by recounting vaguely sourced tales of sexual excess chemical dependency personal unkindness raw business dealings even in some cases dyslexia
the resulting portrait of a dissipated ogre who cant spell is duly presented in hardback form to the public which in turn is so shocked and disgusted that it forces itself to buy the biography by the millions
a cantmiss formula surely
albert goldmans previous victim in the genre was elvis presley
now mr presley was if youll forgive the expression a fat target for a writer of mr goldmans methods
his title notwithstanding the king of rock n roll was in truth more a creature of the old show biz a star whose wholesome image carefully created by pr
wizards was ripe for debunking
but in choosing mr lennon as his next target mr goldman appears to be trying to debunk the undebunkable
for apart from his puerile politics mr lennons favorite topic in the thousands of interviews he gave was his own squalid history his voracious drug use his perfidy to employees his unquenchable sexual promiscuity and so on
by his own accounting then mr lennon was not about to dethrone ward cleaver as the allamerican dad
his public loved him in spite of it all  or perhaps because of it all
mr lennon grew to celebrity during a time when such transgressions as intemperance and adultery quaint terms
were losing their social sting
his candor  if thats what it was and not simple logorrhea  redeemed everything
and so it is on the grounds of insufficient candor that the resourceful mr goldman hot to debunk attacks his subject
the leitmotif of mr lennons confessions was that his worst days were behind him and that with yoko ono he had at last learned to prize the virtues of quietude and domesticity
now mr goldman is here to announce he didnt tell you the half of it
hence this page stew of unrelieved sordidness percolating with the scoops that have by now been widely publicized in people magazine west th and other scholarly venues that mr lennon had a thing for young boys that his marriage to ms ono was pocked by the same faithlessness and rancor that characterized his first marriage that he had a sweet tooth that just wouldnt quit
the squalid revelations dribble out like a chemical leak sliming up every page
remarkably then the sleazemongers art has triumphed mr goldmans john lennon is even worse than john lennons john lennon
a great deal of this muck manages to splash onto ms ono whom mr goldman portrays as a cynical manipulator whose major talent lay in exploiting mr lennon to further her own craving for fame and wealth
mr goldman alas allows to pass unremarked the obvious irony that this is a rather fine thumbnail sketch of himself as well
the keepers of the lennon flame have of course been quick to point this out
ms ono and her son have taken the path preferred by offended celebrities they have hit the talk shows to display their wounds
and rolling stone magazine long the house organ for the lennon publicity machine recently published an extensive rebuttal to the book which was undercut by a tone of priggish indignation bordering on the comic
criticizing the lives of john lennon for insufficient respect to the fallen beatles legacy is rather off the point  like condemning charles manson for his bad table manners
the book may indeed be inaccurate as critics have charged
but one can only hope that quibbles about its veracity do not obscure the countless other reasons to hate mr goldmans book
there is for starters the sloppy pompous prose so suggestive of the gradschool smoking lounge  mr goldman is the sort of writer who refers to pop songs as pieces as though they were concerti
there is his knowing hipperthanthou approach  toward drugs sex music  that gives him license to secondguess mr lennons every move
and there is the awkward organization in which minor events assume large proportions for the simple reason that they reflect badly on mr lennon while major events are skipped over lightly because  there goes the advance
 they might reveal mr lennon in a flattering light
all of which indicates why the lives of john lennon is such a wretched book not because it makes a good man look bad but because it shows no other purpose than to make a man  whether a good man or a bad one we laymen will probably never know  look bad
john lennon while he was alive did enough of that himself to satisfy all but the lowest appetites

the resignation of the land reform secretary raises doubts about president corazon aquinos commitment to agrarian reform and dramatizes conflicts in a government criticized for lack of vision
the controversy climaxed thursday with the resignation of secretarydesignate florencio abad  whose nomination was opposed by the proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino party
handling of the controversy highlighted all the inconsistencies for which mrs aquino has been criticized lack of clear priorities tactical blundering and the strong influence of her relatives over national policy
it also reinforced the suspicion among liberals that for all her rhetoric mrs aquino does not share the deep commitment to social change which they expected when she took power in the  people power uprising against the late ferdinand marcos
the sincerity of corazon aquino is being seriously questioned wrote columnist ninez cachoolivares in the philippine daily inquirer
land reform the centerpiece program of her administration is dead
abads troubles began in february when he tried unsuccessfully to block the lease of government land in cavite province to japans marubeni corp for an industrial park
although the deal was approved by the national development corp abad a former congressman said the land should be distributed to peasants under the agrarian reform program
the department of trade and industry said the marubeni deal was crucial to attracting muchneeded foreign investment for the governments industrialization program
but the department of agrarian reform said if the cavite land was exempted hundreds of landlords would try to have their property declared as a potential industrial site to avoid losing title
the presidential staff finally worked out a compromise under which farmers would be offered either land or a cash settlement
abad reluctantly agreed to the formula under repeated orders from mrs aquino
abads firm stand however alarmed landowners in congress who floated rumors in the press that the agrarian reform department was riddled with communists
lawmakers on the commission on appointments who belong to the proaquino struggle of the democratic filipino party blocked abads confirmation through eight hearings until he finally resigned
despite the partys victory poltical damage to it and mrs aquino was considerable
the manila press transformed abad into a folk hero depicting him as the champion of the farmer against political barons of the struggle of the democratic filipino party dubbed landlorddominated party
worry not about abads destiny mrs president wrote columnist carol arguillas in the manila chronicle
worry about yours and how you blew the last chance for liberal support
mrs aquino pledged publicly to work for abads confirmation but her lobbying appeared ineffectual
abads strongest opponents included politicians who consistently support mrs aquino leading to speculation she was not disappointed when he departed
abads opponents included her younger brother rep jose peping cojuangco who wields considerable influence in government
there is no way cory aquino will challenge peping said one western diplomat speaking on condition of anonymity
mrs aquino comes from a landlord family
she and her brothers and sisters are partners in a acre sugar plantation in tarlac province
rather than break up the estate they used a legal option and created a profitsharing plan for the tenants
the abad controversy was the latest in a series of blows to the agrarian reform program once touted as the centerpiece of the administration
last year agrarian reform secretary philip juico resigned after disclosures that his department paid vastly inflated sums for marginal land
his successor miriam defensor santiago was repeatedly rejected by the commission on appointments only to be reappointed until mrs aquino replaced her with abad on dec 
no reason for the change was given
but mrs santiago claims she did not display sufficient public loyalty to mrs aquino during a coup attempt in early december
agrarian reform was widely seen as a means for breaking the power of landlord families and uplifting the livelihood of millions of peasants
the program was advertised as essential in curbing the yearold ruralbased marxist insurgency
mrs aquino proclaimed a land reform program in  but left details to congress
the final bill contained so many prolandlord loopholes that several of its original sponsors including abad voted against it
robert h reid has been the ap bureau chief in manila since september 
a passenger ferry sank off the caribbean coast while being towed to port and  people drowned and six are missing authorities and news reports said today
capt
anibal giron arreola a spokesman at the puerto barrios naval base said the ferry justo rufino barrios ii sank sunday afternoon in amatique bay

gaytan said the boat sank while it was being towed by a tugboat
the spanish embassy in guatemala city confirmed the sinking and said a yearold spanish citizen vicente daudi was among the dead
the embassy reported his wife rosa maria arnal and a son survived the shipwreck but two daughters were missing
daudi was working with a spanish technical aid and economic development mission in guatemala the embassy said
an official at the puerto barrios morgue said  bodies have been identified
besides daudi the nationalities of the victims were not immediately known
gaytan said navy patrol boats fishing vessels and private craft have been searching the bay for survivors and recovering bodies
he said he had no other details on the shipwreck
puerto barrios  miles northeast of the capital is guatemalas principal east coast port
president corazon aquino of the philippines on monday asked government and industrial leaders to expand economic ties with her nation
mrs aquino on the first stop of her weeklong threenation european tour met with west german president richard von weizsaecker foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and other officials
mrs aquino comparing the task of strengthening the heavily indebted philippine economy to the recovery of west germany after world war ii asked that germany share its experience with her homeland
we have tried by sound fiscal policies not to buy recovery at the price of inflation nor debt relief at the price of national honor she said in a speech to the west german chamber of industry and trade
we have paid as careful attention to the consequences of runaway inflation and devaluation as germany in the light of her own experiences between the wars she said
mrs aquino said the philippines debt was projected to increase to  billion by years end but that much was money that was in fact stolen by the previous government of ousted dictator ferdinand marcos
she said that since her government took over in  the countrys growth rate of minus  percent under marcos in  had improved to a rate of plus  percent by 
what we need to complete the equation are two elements essential to the german recovery  debt relief and investments mrs aquino said
during a state banquet in the evening weizsaecker told mrs aquino her visit would further strengthen relations between west germany and the philippines
weizsaecker said the philippines have had good results in trade with west germany and assured mrs aquino that the barrierfree market the european economic community plans for  will not lock out trade with other countries
mrs aquino who arrived in west germany on sunday will meet with chancellor helmut kohl on tuesday before departing for paris
she also is to visit belgium
the hubble space telescope orbited with its big eye open friday after ground controllers overcame communications problems and lifted its lens cover but its electronics were shut down due to a malfunction
those problems however were not the immediate concern of shuttle discoverys astronauts who prepared for sundays return to earth
youve been released from hubble support
its on its own mission controls story musgrave told the five crew members
thats great news replied discovery commander loren j shriver
there are handshakes and smiles all around up here
ill bet its just that way back down there too added mission specialist steven hawley
whos buying tonight
well buy when you all get back musgrave replied
flight director william reeves said it was too early to cheer
we still have an important part of the mission to go reeves said
we reserve our celebration until the crew is safely on the ground
discovery is to land at  am edt sunday at edwards air force base calif
landing would have been delayed a day if astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had had to perform a space walk to crank open the telescopes lens cover or aperture door
the shuttle trailed  miles behind hubble when the aperture door opened  miles above earth but passed  miles beneath the telescope later in the day
the national aeronautics and space administration had planned to release its first test image from the  billion telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina
but steve terry director of orbital verifications said that would be delayed by problems with hubbles highspeed antennas
scientific data will follow in a month or two
hubbles foot aluminum aperture door was opened to the heavens at  am edt nearly four hours later than planned exposing its finely polished inch mirror to starlight for the first time
ground controllers sent a signal commanding the door to lift even though the telescope was in an automatic safe mode with all motion stopped because of problems in linking its highspeed dish antennas with a relay satellite
one of the two antennas apparently had swung too far and the telescope shut down said jean oliver a hubble deputy project manager
if future movements of the antenna have to be limited to avoid the problem it would have only slight impact on the telescopes observing time oliver said
terry said the opening of the aperture door could not have been delayed much longer
there has to be a point where you say they have to go their way and we have to go ours he said of the astronauts
when the door opened two of hubbles four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working later engineers got them back on line
the motion of the lens cover knocked out the gyros said dave drachlis of the goddard space flight center in maryland
that too kept it in the safe mode
oliver said it would be saturday morning before the telescope is brought out of the safe mode
it will take another day to get the instrument operating normally again putting controllers at goddard several days behind
were trying to be very deliberate and trying not to cut any corners and do anything fast because we feel theres a lot at risk here and we want to make sure were doing it properly oliver said
weve got a long future ahead of us and we want to make sure it starts off on the right foot
nasa said the telescope was safe and in a stable position
tolerances for the telescope systems were set particularly narrow for the first operations and that was the cause of many malfunctions terry said
in addition to that trouble there were two communications outages totaling several hours
were cautious and thats natural terry said
weve got a very expensive spacecraft here and we dont want to do anything to jeopardize the usefulness
 well get to the point where we know exactly what the spacecraft will do and set the limits appropriately
terry said hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods
the telescope will share the system known as tracking and data relay satellites with other space craft
except for a tiny wedge opening the lens cover had been closed and the telescope blind ever since hubble was released by the astronauts wednesday
from its orbit high above earths distorting atmosphere the telescope will enable astronomers over its year working lifetime to look back  billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe
the universe is believed to have been created about  billion years ago in a cosmic explosion
the late astronomer edwin p hubble for whom the telescope is named provided the basis for the big bang theory of creation
he discovered during the s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from earth the faster it is moving away
in honor of the astronomer sullivan carried with her into space an eyepiece from the inch telescope at californias mount wilson observatory that hubble used to make his pioneering observations
its a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes edwin hubbles fundamental contributions to astronomy she said friday afternoon
once back on earth the eyepiece will be displayed at the observatory

who would have thought that snow white of all people would become the source of oscar nights only major glitch
the walt disney co filed suit in los angeles federal court thursday against the academy of motion picture arts and sciences charging copyright infringement of its snow white character and unfair competition
the famous fairy tale character portrayed by singerdancer eileen bowman opened wednesday nights academy awards ceremonies with an elaborate minute songanddance routine
but disney contends that the character was used on the show without the companys permission
we have great respect for the academy and for all that it does frank wells disneys president and chief operating officer said thursday in a prepared statement
we were therefore greatly surprised and dismayed when we viewed last evenings academy awards ceremonies to see that our snow white character had been used extensively without our permission
wells said the suit was filed only after the company asked the academy to publicly apologize for its unauthorized use of the character which debuted in a  fulllength cartoon film
if such a statement had been agreed to by the academy wells said we would have considered the matter ended
for its own reasons however the academy unfortunately did not accede to our request
disney spokesman erwin okun did not provide any details of thursdays negotiations with academy officials over an apology except to say that the academys offer was not to our satisfaction
bruce davis the academys executive administrator declined comment saying top officials needed time to assess the suit
we havent gotten any official notification of this davis said adding that he learned of the legal action from a reporter
ironically the academy is extremely protective of the oscar name and statuette copyrights and is quick to object to the images unauthorized use
number kept secret alan carr who produced the oscar show had ordered that the details of the opening number be kept secret until wednesday nights abc telecast
but in its suit disney says a company representative learned of the plans early in the week
the company claims that the academy refused to respond to its inquiries until wednesday afternoon
at that point the disney statement said the academy through a legal representative denied to disney that the academy award program contained any material deleterious to the interests of disney without revealing the academys intention to feature disneys snow white
carr could not be reached for comment thursday
the snow white character  as portrayed wednesday night by bowman  was created by steve silver who for  years has used the character in the san francisco musical revue beach blanket babylon
disney files dozens of suits a year against individuals and companies that copy its characters particularly in consumer products
we sue all the time okun said
but okun said the company which won four oscars wednesday night has never sued silver over his use of the snow white character in that production
the spokesman however did not preclude the possibility of a future lawsuit
we look at these characters as the heart and soul of the company okun explained
emperor hirohito has lost nearly  pounds in the two months since he fell ill and now weighs only  pounds a palace official was quoted as saying friday
the yearold emperors condition weakened friday but doctors speculated that a scab had stopped internal bleeding in his upper intestinal area said imperial household agency spokesman kenji maeda
hirohito has suffered repeated bouts of bleeding but has not discharged blood in nine days
the emperor responds to queries from aides but is less talkative than before maeda told reporters
he added that doctors sometimes have trouble determining whether hirohito is awake
news reports quoted maeda as saying hirohito has shed much of his normal  pounds during his confinement and now weighs about  pounds
hirohito had a temperature of  degrees friday evening up slightly from the morning
his normal temperature is about  degrees
doctors have said he suffers from jaundice and anemia
maeda said the emperors heart and kidneys were functioning normally
since sept  when he was confined to intensive care after vomiting blood hirohito has received  pints of blood in transfusions
palace officials have not given details on hirohitos illness and they would not comment on japanese news reports that the emperor has pancreatic cancer

mr chairman four of my congressional colleagues and i are here for the purpose of nominating the next vice president of the united states
we are here to nominate one of the bright young lights in the republican party a man i am proud to say is my colleague the junior senator from indiana dan quayle
you know senators get a lot of mail
party leaders more than most
and almost every one of these letters asks for help with some problem
well three years ago i received a handwritten plea from a yearold girl who after several days of long long senate sessions had a very special problem
she wrote and i quote i have my secondgrade play tonight
please make sure my daddy can come home and watch me
i knew corinne quayle was from a political family because she invited me to come along too
corinne and her brothers tucker and benjamin and their mother marilyn share dan quayle with the people of indiana and the united states senate
dan quayle is a dedicated public servant and a devoted family man
and whenever i needed him whenever i needed him dan was there  ready and willing to make the tough choices to cast the tough votes to transform president reagans vision of america into the law of the land
whether it was the budget or defense tax reform or the inf treaty dan quayle was there a forceful advocate and a staunch supporter of the reagan revolution
and now he is ready to carry that revolution forward
and believe me he is ready and just let the democrats try to use experience as a measuring stick in this campaign
just let them try
now i dont mean to suggest their presidential candidate lacks experience
hes got plenty of experience plenty of experience  experience in raising taxes again and again experience in vetoing the pledge of allegiance in public schools experience in increasing spending year after year after year in massachusetts
and i just dont believe the american people want that kind of experience in the white house
it sounds like a dukakeyed idea to me
but dan quayles got experience too
hes already spent  years as a congressman and a senator tackling the vital national and international issues that affect the lives of all americans and the future of our country
that is  more years of national experience than michael dukakis  and he is running for president

and for the purpose of debate only i yield the balance of my time to the outstanding distinguished senior from indiana my good friend sen dick lugar
the two dominant home and automobile insurers in the carolinas said tuesday that they expect to be hit with about  million in claims from hurricane hugo
such heavy losses suggest that the storm will be the most expensive ever for the insurance industry
state farm insurance co expects claims as high as  million in south carolina where it insures one out of every five homes spokesman jerry parsons said
the bloomington illbased company is also projecting an additional  million in claims from storm damage in north carolina and virginia he said
additionally nationwide insurance co said it expects claims close to  million more than triple the  million that the company paid for damages caused by hurricane elena when it swept through florida alabama and mississippi in 
our previous alltime high was in  when we paid  million in comparable claims for hurricane alicia which struck galveston and houston
there were a phenomenal number of claims from that storm but there was not the severity of damage as in hugo parsons said
officials said property damage from hugo escalated because the storm scored a direct hit on charleston and then instead of heading out to sea veered northwest hitting other population centers including charlotte nc losses still being tallied nationwide based in columbus ohio is the biggest home and auto insurance in north carolina where damage was unexpectedly high and is the thirdlargest insurer in south carolina
we have so far received  claims spokesman bob sohozich said
although claims adjusters are still tallying the losses there is now little doubt that overall damage to insured property will far exceed the record  million in claims paid by the industry after hurricane frederic struck mississippi and alabama in  parsons said
the insurance information institute is expected to issue a report thursday on overall insured losses from hugo
although the losses are substantial they are not expected to threaten the financial health of any individual company because reinsurers will pick up a significant portion of the costs
for example nationwide said it would be responsible for up to  million in claims while its reinsurers would cover up to  million in damages
reinsurers  which share a portion of the risk on an insurance policy in exchange for part of the premium income  typically spread their risk over many hundreds of companies
analysts said most of the claims will be borne by mutual insurance companies which are owned by policyholders but they noted that losses from hurricane hugo would also affect the shortterm earnings of some publicly traded companies
continental corp said it expects to report a pretax charge of  million for the third quarter reflecting its net exposure to damages from the storm
the new yorkbased company had substantial business in puerto rico and the virgin islands where hugo first struck with devastating force
forecasts may be cut the charge might push continental into the red for the quarter said udayan ghose an analyst with shearson lehman hutton in new york
if there is a profit it will be a very small one he said
the charge will cut expected annual earnings by close to  he added
ghose said shearson may also cut its thirdquarter and annual earnings projections for cigna corp usfg corp and lincoln national corp which are expected to suffer hurricanerelated losses equal to about  of expected fullyear earnings
overall  catastrophic losses for the industry now total about  billion and analysts expect hugo to make this year the costliest
but this could be a positive for the industry ghose said explaining that the industry is in the middle of a price war because it is overcapitalized
billions of dollars in losses from hugo and other catastrophes this year would have a significant impact on excess capital he said causing insurance firms to raise prices shortly
that would be good for the companies and shareholders he said
pakistani and indian troops exchanged fire for several hours today after a pakistani soldier became the first military casualty on the troubled kashmir border officers and a western observer said
the soldier was shot in the leg sunday at a ceasefire line several miles from the village of chaukothi officials said on condition of anonymity
they said there were no reports of casualties from todays firefight at the line which divides kashmir between pakistan and india
the nations have twice gone to war over the himalayan state in  and again in 
the former princely state was divided between the two nations after british colonial rule ended in 
relations between the neighbors have become increasingly strained since jan  when indian troops launched a military crackdown on moslem separatists in turbulent jammukashmir
the militants want indias only majority moslem state to either become independent or join pakistan
jammukashmir is an aberration in india where  percent of the countrys  million people are hindus
the leaders of both countries have tried to soothe tempers in the dispute and have said another war over the region is unlikely
however pakistani forces have now sealed off the border area at chaukothi forbidding civilians from entering the area
the border crossing was the scene of a bloody confrontation on feb  between indian troops and pakistani students who were marching in solidarity with activists in indianheld kashmir
indian troops killed three students and wounded several during that confrontation a pakistan defence ministry spokesman said
the two armies also exchanged gunfire for about  minutes before calm was restored
a paksitan army captain who said he witnessed the firefight said unlike the occasional shootings in the past indian soldiers appeared to be aiming at pakistani troops
the western observer said sundays shooting of the pakistan soldier appeared to back up that assertion
in another sign of increased tensions pakistani and indian officers are no longer accompanying united nations military observers as they pass through the borders
it is not a normal situation the officer said
the border is extremely tense
pakistan officials said they were taking steps to quell what one official called war fever on the pakistan side
we are trying to tie the people down said amir alan khan a retired lieutenant colonel who heads kashmirs civil defence
he said hundreds of retired soldiers have approached him to ask for orders to fight the indian army
a biography that portrays john lennon as a drugaddled anorexic bisexual who raged his way from liverpool to new york city is totally fiction yoko ono said in a national radio broadcast
its amazing that somebody took such a poetic license
i dont see john in there 
its a very dramatically described something but its not about john ono said wednesday night in her first broadcast comments on the book by albert goldman
the usually reclusive ono agreed to the interview to counter goldmans the lives of john lennon which presents the exbeatle as a violent drugaddicted drunk who wanted to dump his wife
as for ono goldman shows her as a golddigger who snorted heroin up to the time of lennons death
goldman also charges she was responsible for paul mccartneys  marijuana bust in japan had affairs while they were married and was just as intent on a divorce as lennon
ono refuted virtually all of these charges and countered through taped interviews with lennon friends and employees that goldmans book was based on unreliable sources and misquotes
its totally fiction yoko said during the hourlong program which opened with lennons song gimme some truth and coincided with the books national release wednesday
these people in this book are not us
its not john and me ono continued
its unfair hes been assaulted and cant hit back
 for some reason this book is attempting to rob both john and i of the basic human dignity that were entitled to
the ono interview was taped aug  at the dakota where the lennons lived  and yoko still lives with their son sean
lennon was murdered by mark david chapman outside the dakota on dec  
the interview was broadcast nationwide via the westwood one network spokeswoman laurie wilde said an exact figure on how many stations picked up the broadcast was not available
also appearing were sean and lennon other son julian
ono was interviewed by longtime associate elliot mintz who is described in goldmans book as a spy for yoko  a charge mintz denied during the show
it is for one very upsetting but most of all it is lies untruths 
the whole thing is just sickening said julian who also refuted goldmans tales of lennon as a violent father
mintz read excerpts from the book to yoko who then responded to the allegations point by point
she denied that lennon was homosexual that he was using drugs while living at the dakota with his son sean that he had become a reclusive rock n roll howard hughes
she did acknowledge having a heroin problem during the late s but rejected goldmans assertion that she had a aweek habit
the book has already drawn angry responses from friends of lennon and ono mccartney who contradicted one anecdote involving lennon smashing a painting in pauls home has urged a boycott of the book
after yokos rebuttal listeners were invited to dial digit telephone numbers to vote on whether the book was an accurate portrayal of the lennons life
results were not expected until later today
goldman who conducted more than  interviews for his lennon book has written controversial biographies of comedian lenny bruce and elvis presley
one year ago tomorrow mr john major surprised everyone but himself by winning the general election
his honeymoon after a very personal victory was shortlived and now he begins the second year of his hardwon term as a deeply unpopular leader who has everything still to prove
the past  months have been hijacked by internal party differences over europe by the debacle surrounding uk withdrawal from the exchange rates mechanism of the european monetary system and by a continuing deep recession which has disappointed and alienated many traditional tory supporters in business
mr majors anniversary inevitably led yesterday to an outbreak of political pointscoring over the governments record
while mr tony newton leader of the commons conceded no one pretends that the last year has been easy he also claimed that much had been achieved
the governments efforts to secure a framework for longterm prosperity was beginning to pay off
mr john smith the labour leader was joined by  frontbench colleagues in launching a counterattack involving a detailed and documented indictment of mr majors failures
he attacked the tories for building a bonfire of preelection commitments
tory allegiances in the business world have also been put under immense pressure though criticism over policy drift and inaction may soften as recession ends
yesterday sir michael angus president of the confederation of british industry remained cautious but volunteered if i were a betting man i would say we have the embryo of a recovery
mr major can take little comfort from the conclusion widespread among industrialists that his greatest achievement in the past year has been britains withdrawal from the erm  something which he resisted and over which in the end he had no control
most industrialists however find it hard to criticise mr major as an individual with many drawing a flattering parallel between his personal qualities and those of his predecessor
he still attracts gratitude for the election victory which was seen  despite subsequent problems for the economy  as the best result for business
but unlike the previous no  occupant he is seen as a weak leader with little vision and bereft of a clearly articulated political conviction
there is a general perception that important though britains future place in europe is the prime minister has been excessively preoccupied with community affairs and associated internal party ructions to the detriment of the domestic economy
many industrialists are pleased that mr major is now attempting to reshape economic strategy in favour of the manufacturing base
but the jury is out on whether the rhetoric will give way to effective action

moslem militants killed five people who opposed their fight for independence from predominantly hindu india and kidnapped a former legislator officials said saturday
at least  people mostly moslem demonstrators have been killed in the northern state of jammukashmir since jan  when the government launched a crackdown on the separatists
state officials said four of the five people killed friday and saturday were moslems
they were identified as a deputy police superintendent the yearold local leader of the communist party of india the grandson of another prominent communist leader and a man accused of being a police informer
the fifth victim was a civilian the sources added speaking on condition of anonymity
it was unclear if he was hindu or moslem
the former state legislator mir mustafa was pulled out of his car at gunpoint saturday near his home in badgam  miles west of srinagar officials said
srinagar has been a focal point of the fighting between government troops and separatists
family members and highly placed sources in the government of jammukashmir said no group has claimed responsibility for the abduction and no demands were issued
mustafa was an independent member of the state legislature
the governing body was dissolved in january when the federal crackdown was ordered
in december mustafa helped negotiate a prisoner exchange in which the kidnapped daughter of home minister mufti mohammad saeed was swapped for five prominent members of the radical jammukashmir liberation front
the front is one of several moslem militant groups waging a campaign of bombings and assassinations to press demands for the independence of kashmir a part of jammukashmir state
jammukashmir is the only moslemmajority state in india
the secession movement has been simmering since  when the state of kashmir was divided between india and moslem pakistan
the eastern part of the state is governed by india
the western slice of kashmir is under pakistans control
the two countries went to war twice over kashmir and their armies still face each other along the disputed frontier
jurors who have reached verdicts on  counts in the mcmartin preschool molestation case said wednesday they are deadlocked on the remaining  charges in the nations longest costliest criminal trial
superior court judge william pounders received a note from the jurors as they ended their days deliberation and called a hearing for thursday to discuss the deadlock and possibly opening the  sealed verdicts
in an interview wednesday evening pounders said he would deal with the deadlocked counts first either declaring a mistrial on those counts and reading the sealed verdicts or sending the jury back to resume deliberations on the undecided counts
he said the verdicts could also be read before sending the jury back
however the judge noted that the attorneys are hopeful all the counts will be resolved before we take any verdicts
pounders said he would discuss the matter with attorneys before quizzing jurors on whether they want to deliberate further
the jurors are deciding whether raymond buckey  and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey  are guilty or innocent of charges they molested children at their familyowned mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach
the jury that spent  years hearing evidence in the case have agreed on  verdicts
they have all been sealed
none of the verdicts is official until it is announced in court and affirmed by the jury
jurors are in their ninth week of deliberations
buckey and his mother are charged with  counts of child molestation and the one shared count of conspiracy
one of the charges which apparently has divided the jurors is the conspiracy charge which names both defendants
jurors asked twice for an explanation of how they could convict one defendant and acquit the other on that joint charge but seemed perplexed after they received an explanation earlier wednesday
after conferring with lawyers pounders told jurors they could convict just one of the defendants on the charge if you feel that the defendant conspired with one or more other persons
however he noted the conspiracy count includes eight alleged overt acts some of them naming only one defendant
a split verdict he said would require elimination of overt acts alleged against a defendant acquitted of the charge
it was at that point he said that some jurors began shaking their heads in confusion
buckey and his mother were the only defendants required to stand trial after an month preliminary hearing
five women teachers who worked at the mcmartin preschool had charges against them dismissed
among those were buckeys sister peggy ann and his grandmother virginia mcmartin who founded the prestigious but now defunct nursery school
on tuesday deliberations were halted at midday because a juror became ill on wednesday the talks did not begin until  pm because another jurors child was ill no alternates remain in the case and the judge has worried that losing one of the  remaining jurors would force a mistrial
the invasion iraqs troops led by about  tanks crossed the border at dawn thursday and seized the kuwaiti palace and government buildings  miles away
early friday the invaders controlled kuwait city the capital
the soldiers were also making sweeps through the southern oilfields according to residents and lloyds insurance service in london
diplomatic sources estimate more than  kuwaitis were killed or wounded mainly from the emiri guard which bore the main brunt of the invasion
kuwaits sheik saad alabdullah alsabah fled to safety in saudi arabia
the forces iraq a country of more than  million has the arab worlds most battletrained army and had massed more than  soldiers on the kuwaiti border
kuwait an oilrich citystate has  million residents   percent foreigners  and an army of  soldiers
cause of conflict president saddam hussein of iraq accused kuwait of stealing oil from its territory and forcing down oil prices through overproduction
kuwait and un diplomats dismissed iraqs claim that it invaded at the request of kuwaiti revolutionaries
reaction the un security council voted  to condemn the invasion
president bush denounced it as naked agression
he froze iraqs assets in the united states and blocked almost all iraqi imports including oil
the order also froze kuwait property under us jurisdiction  a move intended to keep iraq from seizing it
the soviets also condemned the invasion and stopped arms sales to iraq
kuwaits us ambassador said the nation had asked for american military intervention
a pentagon source said a us naval group was diverted toward the persian gulf
oil prices soared in frenzied trading amid fears the invasion would reduce the supply of oil
the discovery astronauts triumphantly launched the billion hubble space telescope one orbit late today after lastditch commands from earth freed a stuck solar panel narrowly averting a daring emergency spacewalk
the telescope began orbiting earth every  minutes at an altitude of  miles  high above the atmosphere which has limited the view of groundbased telescopes
discovery go for hubble release mission control told the crew at  pm pdt
the event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away as the telescope glinting in the sunlight drifted off on its year search for new worlds
the final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescopes instruments
the starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel
mission control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help
but there was a third try and it was successful
we have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed the telescope control center in maryland said
so we have good news said dave drachlis of the hubble control center
the deployment of the two foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescopes batteries relieving worries that they would use up their eighthour charge
before astronaut steve hawley was able to lift the  ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttles mechanical arm its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttles power and shifted over to the batteries
astronauts kathryn sullivan and bruce mccandless had put on spacesuits and entered an air lock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array in case mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed
the first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday as the shuttle passed  miles above south americas eastern coast
it started providing power to the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge
deployment of the starboard panel however was more troublesome
it refused to budge when latches were first released then moved about a fifth of its foot length and stopped again
a third attempt rolled the panel out all the way
houston we see motion commander loren j shriver reported
hawley began the long process of releasing hubble shortly after  am pdt when he grasped the hubble with discoverys footlong mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the  ton telescope high above the shuttle
discovery was  miles above earth  miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown
the orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the earths distorting atmosphere
discoverys five astronauts were awed by the view
id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer  something to the effect that the big marble earth sure looks far away today shriver said of hawley
made in america my story by sam walton doubleday dollars 
 pages being an american folk hero is a tricky assignment as ross perot found out
the problem is that the great american public likes its bootstrap entrepreneurs to be very rich and very upright
in a country where business practices are not overly genteel this is a tough combination to achieve
a vast media circus meanwhile is quick to expose any flaws
sam walton founder of the walmart chain of discount supermarkets who died of cancer in april negotiated these pitfalls much better than most
when in  forbes magazine declared him americas richest entrepreneur the paparazzi descended on the obscure corner of arkansas mainly occupied by chicken farmers where walton made his home
what they found was a happily married muchliked billionaire who enjoyed quail hunting breakfasted at the local holiday inn and drove a battered pickup truck minus two hubcaps
folksy was an understatement
since then some aspects of walmarts business  its antiunion policies the impact of its dollars bn annual sales on hundreds of momandpop shops have been subject to critical scrutiny
so to an extent have the less wholesome adventures of the four walton children
but no one has ever been able to make sam himself look bad
the worst that has been said is that he was rather dull
walton is not about to dash anyones illusions
readers will either find his autobiography lashed with good ol commonsense and a lot of harmless if charming anecdotes
or they will find it dreary and downbeat
walton makes no excuses i realise this may sound boring to most you he writes at one stage but one of my best items ever was a mattress pad called a bedmate 
a few snippets are more revealing about the character
there cannot be many billionaires who admit that they never learned handwriting too well  and have the guts to include a photograph which demonstrates the point
meanwhile the competitive energy which sam walton applied to his business is inescapable
in one of many contributions from friends and family don soderquist walmarts chief operating officer tells of finding sam one saturday morning on his hand and knees at the local kmart store analysing his rivals stock
and his wife in a casual aside notes that when the couple was on holiday in italy their luggage vanished while her husband was off on a similar scouting mission
but it is david glass walmarts current chief executive who perhaps captures the entrepreneurial walton spirit best
explaining the annual contest in which walmart executives choose one volume producing item to promote he recalls the time sam who usually won selected minnow buckets for carrying bait
glass was more happily teamed with apple juice
so i would go down to the stores and get them to take that minnow bucket 
put ice in it ice down the juice and give away samples out of his minnow bucket
i particularly did it in stores i knew sam was going to visit
it drove him crazy and he got off that minnow bucket pretty quick 
but the reader cant help feeling that the cosy yarns tell only half the truth
sam walton was a salesman to the core and seems to have packaged himself with all the skill that he once applied to selling a gooey southern sweet called moon pies
for the most part this makes for an engaging if onedimensional portrait
occasionally it just grates
i had bought a bank in bentonville for about about dollars  walton remarks for example just a little old bank with only about dollars m in deposits
but it helped me learn a lot about financing things
oh come on sam is that the whole story
the real truth one suspects comes right at the end of the book  when walton admits that if i hadnt gotten sick i doubt i would have written this book
given the pleadings of publishers  doubleday paid about dollars m for the manuscript  and a rather natural desire to have a final say he can hardly be blamed for agreeing to write it
but these are unlikely to be circumstances which make for the most critical selfanalysis
at the end of the day sam waltons heritage is in the shopping malls not the bookstores
the bush administration is expected to name career diplomat harry shlaudeman as the first us ambassador to nicaragua in almost two years a us official says
the administration had planned to send another career diplomat melissa wells to managua but had a change of heart after concluding she might face a prolonged senate confirmation fight because she has been a target of conservatives
the administration is eager to have an ambassador in managua quickly because of the delicate political situation there now that usbacked president violeta chamorro has taken over after almost  years of rule by the leftist sandinista party
mrs chamorro faces the demanding challenges of reviving nicaraguas bankrupt economy and achieving national reconciliation after long years of warfare
the united states has had no ambassador to nicaragua since july 
at the time the sandinista government expelled ambassador richard melton and seven others at the embassy on grounds they were interfering in the countrys internal affairs
the reagan administration retaliated by expelling eight nicaraguan envoys in washington including ambassador carlos tunnermann
shlaudeman who has served as ambassador to argentina peru brazil and venezuela is a premier state department specialist on latin america and is expected to win easy senate confirmation
he retired from the foreign service a year ago but was called back to duty last fall to serve as a state department liaison with the nicaraguan contra rebels
shlaudeman who will turn  next week was approached by a senior state department official weeks ago about going to managua but said he was not interested
he told intimates he would agree to go only if asked personally by president bush
when bush telephoned him earlier this week shlaudeman agreed to the appointment the us official who spoke on condition of anonymity said wednesday
in addition to his ambassadorial posts shlaudeman was the top latin america aide to president ford in the mids and a diplomatic troubleshooter in central america under president reagan
the us official said sen jesse helms rnc and several of his conservative allies would not assure the administration that they would not delay wells nomination
when wells was nominated to be ambassador to mozambique in late  helms and his colleagues blocked her appointment for  months
they took the action as a means of expressing opposition to the reagan administrations friendship toward mozambiques marxist government
woof
 in this house man and dogs speak as one
their relationship is unusually tender
one need only listen while wegman murmurs to fay ray and battina her  yearold daughter
 on valentines day for example he said ill take them out and play with them longer
 but i dont want to be known as a dog zombie said wegman who did go to the westminster kennel club dog show without the dogs
i go to movies and have friends and play sports
i swim play tennis and wind surf
 battina begs to differ
when bill leaves batty howls said andrea beeman an assistant to wegman
 man and dog their home is one floor of a former orthodox synagogue on the lower east side of manhattan
during a recent visit it was possible to see how the artist gets two eventempered relaxed normal dogs to slip into florid housedresses or scratch each others backs
the three simply adore each other
 id never heard of weimaraners said the artist who was born  years ago in longmeadow mass
his life with weimaraners began in  the year he bought a new video camera and man ray a puppy that cost 
 wegman had never photographed dogs before but man ray was a perfect subject
 he was gray and neutral the artist said
i could do him as a dog a man a sculpture a character a bat a frog an elephant an airedale a dinosaur a poodle
i never got tired of him
 a dogs life had he been a different breed he would have been a character actor wegman said like lassie
 when man ray who had become world famous died of cancer in  at the age of  years and  months the artist mourned
i dreamed that he came back to life said wegman who spent three years living without a dog
it was kind of liberating the years i didnt have a dog
 in  however he got another weimaraner which was stolen
yet another dog died of parvo a virus
in  he got fay ray who is now a familiar face not only among artists but among children who watch sesame street
 as a breed weimaraners combine a lapdog sensibility with a hunting capability the artist said
they curl up on his lap but since they are pointers they can hold a pose
 they are also good companions for an artist
they are affectionate
they do not drool
they have style
 like worldfamous fashion models these dogs are lean supple and fit
in wegmans home which comprises  square feet with foothigh ceilings they live a life unencumbered  one assumes  by thoughts of fame or fortune and seldom hunger
 each morning wegman feeds them eukanuba dog food which he considers the best around
its the highest in protein
he said
he often adds a spoonful of plain yogurt or cottage cheese
the dogs eat again at  pm the house is designed for both human and canine comfort
there is nowhere that wegman goes that the dogs do not
the yard is a run of dirt and concrete
if their master does not play with them the dogs just scratch sniff get bored and go to the door to wait for him

the scarred battleship iowa made a somber return sunday to its home port where about  family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed  sailors
sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the norfolk naval bases pier 
twenty minutes later families started filing aboard the ship exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors
the explosion wednesday flashed through the iowas no
 gun turret which extends six decks down into the ship
there were  survivors inside the turret all on the lowest deck where they were loading powder from the ships magazines the navy said
crewmen stand on turret two of the surviving crewmen of no

when the vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers among those on the dock but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier
adm powell f carter commander in chief of the atlantic fleet was there to greet the vessel
as the ship docked three marines raised a flag to halfstaff at the stern
the navy kept the news media about  yards from the families and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or crewmen
the violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the navy on sunday
the tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns
jet of intense fire the detonation which appears to blast away the gasketlike rubber bloomers that seal the turrets gun slits is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse

they are effective he said
they were relatively cheap to bring back into service compared to new ships theyre good cruise missile platforms so i do think they have a role to play
the question is how you do that and how you pay for it
invading iraqis have been permitted to take over the homes and even wear the clothes of kuwaitis who have been killed or have fled their homeland kuwaits ambassador to the united states charged tuesday
sheik saud al nasir al sabah said in an interview that he had spoken by telephone to several kuwaitis taking refuge in saudi arabia and bahrain who reported that the iraqis had made it easy for them to leave
that is because the fleeing kuwaitis apparently are being replaced by iraqis seeking to meld in with the local population he contended
they are trucking them in busing them in trying to replace the population to change the makeup of the place saud said adding they were issuing the new residents cards that identify them as kuwaiti citizens
they are giving them kuwaiti clothes in order to make it appear that these are the people of kuwait
they are taking the houses robbing the houses
kuwaiti officials who have been detained by the iraqi military and who have refused to cooperate have been executed saud claimed adding we have eyewitness reports
some were bused back to baghdad for further interrogation
we dont know what has become of them
kuwaiti refugees have also reported that almost all government buildings and palaces have been blown up and destroyed saud said
there has been mass destruction he said noting that all official installations except the water system and oil equipment are ruined
everything is gone

when i opened my eyes and looked around there was just a pile of rubble where the apartments used to be
culpeppers head and arms were cut in the collapse
manager bob husman of a golbro jewelry store ordered employees into the vault shortly before the roof and walls crashed down on him  feet from the vault
in the jewelry business the vault is the safest place he said
i had structural steel on me but managed to crawl out
it was the worst kind of nightmare

india suffered a fresh wave of terror last night when an explosion destroyed two blocks of flats in the centre of the city of calcutta killing at least  people and injuring scores of others
police said a bomb exploded in the crowded trade and residential district of bowbazaar shortly after midnight causing two blocks of flats to collapse and trapping up to  people in the rubble
the identity of the bombers was unknown but the explosion comes just five days after over  people were killed and at least  injured in a series of bomb attacks aimed at the heart of the indian business capital of bombay
a militant sikh group fighting for independence for the indian state of punjab has claimed responsibility for the bombay blasts but police are unconvinced saying they were carried out by a foreign group in connivance with local criminals
in what many interpreted as a reference to pakistan with whom india has fought three wars last week mr shankarrao chavan the federal home interior minister told parliament in new delhi that he suspected an international conspiracy
most of the estimated  people living in the calcutta flats were in their beds when the blast occurred setting fire to both buildings according to officials in the citys central control room
at least  people were dead on arrival at hospital they said
last friday a series of car bombs exploded in bombay in what the government described as a systematic attack on indias commercial heart
among the targets were the bombay stock exchange the landmark air india building a shopping complex and two hotels near the airport
the attacks in calcutta and bombay are a severe setback to attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence which has caused deep shock throughout india
more than  people died in riots including over  in bombay after the razing of a mosque at ayodhya in northern india by hindu zealots on december 
some fear the wave of bomb attacks is designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and undermine efforts by the government of mr p v narasimha rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism
last night national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence
mr rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the inhuman and criminal blast
cement blocks were all that remained of homes fallen branches stood where trees used to be and muddy streams meandered through the outskirts of this ohio river town after a furious flash flood
residents donned shorts and hipwaders friday to begin putting their lives back together after  inches of rain fell in  hours late thursday churning floodwaters that left at least  people dead and  others missing early today
the shock had not worn off said police officer bruce fink whose bristly face bore signs of more than  hours on duty including work at a temporary morgue set up at a funeral home
we have counselors back there now but weve lost whole families
its just been devastating he said friday night
fink said he feared there wouldnt be enough funeral homes to handle the dead in this eastern ohio town of  people
allan hans called the flooding the devils work
i lost everything but my car and the clothes im wearing he said
hans said he was sitting in his trailer when he heard a branch crack and went to check out the noise
he saw rushing water ran to tell neighbors and moved his car
the trailer was swept away by the time he returned home
john and sue wright whose home rests on the banks of pipe creek estimated they lost about  worth of property
i was one of the lucky ones
what i lost i can replace wright said
although it was the center of rescue operations downtown shadyside suffered no apparent flood damage
but it was a different story on the outskirts of town in the heart of ohios richest coal fields
cars were mired roofdeep in mud and guardrails and chunks of concrete were torn from roads
a foot inch thick beam that held a sign leading to ks bar near pipe creek was twisted like a pretzel by the force of what witnesses described as a wall of water
people moved rubble and made makeshift repairs to bridges that span mcmann creek which links homes to ohio route 
many bridges were washed away
small tractors and fourwheeldrive vehicles were the only means of transportation in much of the stricken area
at least  members of the ohio national guard were called in to patrol and to help rebuild floodswept roads said stacie gilg a spokeswoman for the ohio emergency management agency
disasters always bring out the curious and this was no exception
by friday night traffic jammed ohio route  which skirts the ohio river and is the main northsouth road through town
belmont county sheriff tom mccort said he suspected many of the vehicles belonged to sightseers
mccort said there were no serious attempts at looting
he said he was pleased with the assistance of young people
one young man turned in a strongbox filled with valuable coins lost in the flood the sheriff said
the kid  handed me this box and it was unlocked mccort said
it really made me feel good
the soviet union said today that a united germany can join nato after a fiveyear transition period during which all soviet and us troops would leave the country
the united states rejected the proposal a us official said
the proposal was outlined by soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze during international talks in east berlin on the strategic future of a united germany
the remarks a copy of which were obtained by the associated press indicates that a united germany would be free to join the western nato alliance after a fiveyear transitional period
but in exchange western and soviet troops would pull out of the country and germanys own military strength would be sharply reduced according to the proposal
shevardnadze made the proposal as he met with us secretary of state james a baker iii and their counterparts from britain france and the two german states
i am underwhelmed baker said when asked about the soviet proposal while posing for pictures with the other foreign ministers
a us official speaking on condition of anonymity said us officials objected to the fiveyear time limit before germany could join nato
the official said the other western ministers expressed the same reservations
the united states wants a united germany to be a member of the north atlantic treaty organization and the soviet union has been staunchly opposed
west germany now is a mainstay of nato and east germany is a member of the sovietled warsaw pact
shevardnadze said the soviet proposal seeks to limit the strength of the german armed forces and to revamp their structure to make sure that they are rendered incapable for offensive operations
it said those reductions could be undertaken over a threeyear period
germany also would be prevented from producing or deploying chemmical or nuclear weapons
it also said that within six months of unification all western troops should leave west berlin which remains technically under military occupation by the united states france and britian
the four nations would reduce their military forces in the country during a threeyear period following unification first by  percent then bring them down to a level of token contingents or completely withdraw them from germany
there are about  soviet troops in east germany while a quartermillion us troops are stationed in west germany along with tens of thousands of british and french soldiers
previously the soviets had said their troops would stay in what is now east germany for several years but had left unclear the exact plans for pulling them out
shevardnadze speaking earlier at a ceremony for the removal of the western allies checkpoint charlie said he wanted the big four powers troops out of greater berlin within six months after unification
the proposal as translated into english by the soviets and distributed to the news media apparently would also include the kremlins soldiers stationed just outside the city proper
the united states france and great britain have an estimated  troops in west berlin
an official reached by telephone in the office of the military attache at the soviet embassy in east berlin said there were no soviet troops stationed in the city proper

we formally began operations july 
quayle conceded friday that the resume entry was inaccurate and said his staff had written the document
if it indicated that that is inaccurate
i didnt hold that job for two years quayle told reporters aboard his campaign plane
earlier however quayle spokesman david prosperi called the revelation of the error by the plain dealer of cleveland a cheap shot
quayle was hired as an entrylevel research assistant by the state attorney generals office in  after he returned from six months of basic and advanced training for the indiana national guard
quayle a  graduate of depauw university was attending indiana university law school at the time
m stanton evans then an editor with the indianapolis news helped arrange his job interview with the state
evans worked for eugene c pulliam quayles grandfather and publisher of the news
at no point in any of this did dan quayle ask any favors or use any influence said evans now with the national journalism center in washington dc he wouldnt have been hired as a chief investigator
he was hired in an entrylevel job and was promoted to a whole bunch of jobs on his merits
its a nothing story evans said
theodore sendak the attorney general at the time recently had surgery and is unable to comment according to his son timothy sendak
patricia gifford a marion superior court judge who was then an assistant attorney general said friday that prior to the establishment of the consumer protection division all complaints and inquiries were handled by me
the legal assistant assigned to me and utilized as my chief investigator was dan quayle
her statement was released by the quayle campaign
the consumer protection division was created by the state legislature to resolve complaints over defective products false claims in ads faulty speedometer readings and mailorder fraud
in  quayle referred to himself as a vietnamera veteran in campaign literature when he was running against threeterm incumbent birch bayh in a senate race
quayle who enlisted in the indiana national guard dropped the reference after objections by some vietnam combat veterans
in that same election which he won quayle said he was on active duty for several periods during his tenure in the guard
the statement referred to periods when quayle was in basic training and  days of camp each summer
president corazon aquino on friday refused to allow ferdinand marcos to return home to die and said her government wont permit him to be buried here despite a last appeal from his wife
the yearold marcos was in critical condition friday in a honolulu hospital after emergency kidney surgery
hospital officials said the ousted leader was suffering from renal cardiac and pulmonary failure
marcos wife imelda broadcast an appeal friday to mrs aquino to allow her husband to die in his homeland and his supporters threatened mass protests if the request is rejected
but mrs aquino refused to withdraw her ban on marcos and the philippine supreme court rejected a petition from the former presidents lawyer juan david to order the return
marcos has lived in hawaii since he was ousted three years ago in a popular uprising that propelled mrs aquino to power
i would like first of all to convey to the family of mr marcos that i do pray that he will still recover from this latest critical illness mrs aquino said
i regret very much it is not possible for us to allow him to return
she said she has said in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incidents
mrs aquino whose government has survived six coup attempts has cited national security in refusing previous requests
in a statement broadcast by a promarcos radio station mrs marcos said she has tried to telephone mrs aquino from hawaii but was told the president was busy
maria elena cruz mrs aquinos daughter and personal secretary said the president received no calls from mrs marcos
mrs marcos said she was trying to contact the president to make a last appeal to madame corazon aquino to open her heart and let ferdinand come home because he is in very serious condition
my countrymen i am appealing to each and every one of you to pray that hopefully mrs aquino will know that bringing home marcos will bring true reconciliation true peace and unity for our country mrs marcos said
this is whats best for the country
mrs aquino had said earlier i regret to inform mrs marcos if indeed she is asking me for reconsideration because as i have said in the past much as i agree that mr marcos has his rights i still have to consider also the rights and interests of millions of filipinos
when told of mrs aquinos statement mrs marcos said we are aware but i am a believer and i am an optimist
i know miracles can happen
marcos supporters meanwhile announced they would hold rallies saturday to pray for his recovery
promarcos leaders warned the former presidents death in exile would trigger demonstrations
we expect tactical alliances in this nationwide mass action said promarcos lawyer oliver lozano
we refer to the tactical alliances of the military labor sector and student sector
but the chief of staff gen renato de villa said the armed forces would accept mrs aquinos decision and was prepared to block any attempts by the opposition to foment trouble
we will do everything in our power to see to it that law and order prevail de villa told reporters
we will follow any decision by the executive branch

president mikhail s gorbachev met tuesday with east german premier hans modrow and appeared to be more open toward eventual german reunification
modrow told reporters after the meeting that gorbachev did not rule out such a prospect in the future and at the same time did not venture to set some time limits for that
earlier the kremlin chief said any such decisions must include the four allied powers and take into account european opinions
the development of events in the world in east germany in the soviet union demand deep consideration and an analytical approach to deciding this problem he said in remarks reported by the official news agency tass
time itself is acting on this process giving it dynamism gorbachev said
we have to act responsibly and not decide this important question on the streets
tass said gorbachev emphasized that talks about restructuring relations between the two germanys must involve all directly interested governments
asked by an east german correspondent about his attitude toward reunification gorbachev said the question was not unexpected and that no one can cast doubt on the reasonableness of asking it
however the englishlanguage tass translation indicated gorbachev could have meant there were no doubts about reunification itself
gorbachevs position was similar to that adopted by communists in east berlin on tuesday
for the first time the communists acknowledged german unity as a longterm goal but said it must be imbedded in the process of overcoming europes overall divisions
the soviet union traditionally has strongly opposed any talk of german reunification but gorbachev has softened that position in adopting a policy that has allowed radical reform in eastern europe
soviets say the question of german reunification is to be decided in the future
gorbachev in comments to reporters after meeting french president francois mitterrand in kiev in december reiterated his view that the existence of two german states is a fact based on the outcome of world war ii
but he added the present situation is the result of specific historical events a specific historical process on this continent
so history should decide the future of this continent
i dont think it is a topical question today
a different approach may create a situation that would complicate the entire european process including the relations between the two german states gorbachev said
modrow said the two germanys could work toward confederation in phases with no time limit
he said he agreed with gorbachev that reunification must be decided not only by east and west germany but all of europe
according to tass the soviet leader said any action on reunification must not infringe on the interests of either east or west germany the four allied powers france britain the united states or the soviet union or anyone else in europe
count otto lambsdorff head of west germanys free democratic party a partner in the governing coalition said tuesday in london that gorbachev has adopted a more positive attitude toward german reunification
in a tv interview on britains channel  he also urged economic union within  months as a prelude to full union of west and east germany
lambsdorff said that because of east germanys political instability it had only two choices  unification or chaos
modrow invited gorbachev and premier nikolai i ryzhkov to visit east germany and they accepted tass reported
modrow arrived in moscow late monday
a communist he has moved forward the countrys first free elections from may to march  and brought the opposition into a coalition that will govern until then
it is a sensational shortlist a bestseller about love and hypnotism a blockbuster about battles and brides in ruritania and a pornographic shocker about teenage sex and baby murder so explicit that only an obscure newcastle publisher would risk printing it
out are the eminences gris of victorian letters  novels by thomas hardy and mrs humphry ward who advised gladstone and roosevelt didnt make the grade
this week the shortlist for the hypothetical  booker prize will be announced by six judges including biographer victoria glendinning and broadcaster melvyn bragg
they have avoided dull and worthy classics and chosen six books which stirred the fin de siecle world and remain compelling today george du mauriers trilby anthony hopes the prisoner of zenda george moores esther waters kiplings jungle book george gissings in the year of jubilee and rl stevensons the ebb tide
the winner will be revealed on october  four days after the  booker prize ceremony at the cheltenham festival of literature
like todays booker prize it is a publishing gimmick everyman which is backing the spoof award is a significant publisher of classic victorian novels
but the retrospective booker is also a fascinating exercise in historical reconstruction
it raises questions about how the relationship between literature and society has changed in the past  years
first the similarities
a good yarn is a good yarn
of the  books trilby is the tale of a tonedeaf model who sings like an angel when mesmerised by the sinister hypnotist svengali then croaks like a crow when he dies during one of her concerts
the prisoner of zenda tells of an englishman impersonating the king of ruritania and rescuing him from demons
on the  list romesh guneskeras reef is about a sri lankan servant boy and his mysterious master while jill paton walshs knowledge of angels reenacts the wolfchild legend
all the books on both lists are gripping stories
the lists share key themes
both for instance have books about colonial exploitation  stevensons the ebb tide and abdulrazak gurnahs paradise which is set in the first world war in german east africa
both provoke in similar ways
the controversial books of  were trilby with its louche vie boheme milieu and esther waters in which a yearold girl is seduced impregnated and offered the services of a professional baby killer for a fiver
it is now seen as moores best work but in  it had problems finding a publisher and the powerful circulating libraries refused to take it
a century on the relationship between fiction and sexual morality remains vexed
last week a times critic complained about the inclusion of alan hollinghursts candid novel of homosexual love the folding star on the booker list because it offended judaeochristian ethics
but even if hollinghurst wins the booker his novel will not become the succes de scandale of esther waters and trilby which became the bestselling novel of the th century
for the great difference between then and now is that in  a booker prize was not needed to sell fiction
today we accept the gap between literary writing such as hollinghursts and popular bestsellers by writers like jeffrey archer and barbara cartland
this is the gap the booker tries to bridge by giving highlevel publicity to works which would not normally reach a mass audience
the trick works  last years winner roddy doyles paddy clarke ha ha ha sold  hardback copies
before the shortlist was announced it sold 
the victorians in contrast were lovers of contemporary fiction
novels accounted for  per cent of published books and no distinction was made between high and low art
in the mid th century dickens made pounds  for little dorrit the equivalent of nearly pounds  today
between  and  when the population of the uk was half that of today and the literate population smaller still mrs henry woods east lynne sold  copies
all the  booker writers were popular names they were also serious skilful writers whose books can be reread with pleasure  years later
why was fiction so much closer to the public heart in 
social cultural and psychological reasons play a part
socially the s reading public was a vastly more homogenous group than today a small number of middle class authors wrote for a middle class audience at a time when to be literate was to belong to an elite
the idea of a twotier up and downmarket fiction was irrelevant
culturally these writers and readers were certain of their place in the mainstream and the novel was their political and intellectual forum
today we no longer share the victorian confidence in the novel as a key genre of our age
modernism and the overturning of the traditional form by joyce and woolf weakened thcentury belief in the novel and encouraged the divergence between highbrow and lowbrow
the dominance of film and television has made novels a more marginal form and perhaps they no longer attract the most creative talents
george du maurier originally offered the outline of trilby to henry james who he thought would write a better novel
today du maurier would have sold it to hollywood or the bbc
the fantasy element of fiction in which we identify with characters as if we know them was answered in the th century by the novel in the th century we have tv soaps
just as the tabloid newspapers feature characters from eastenders so when dickens the old curiosity shop was running as a serial there was widespread press speculation on whether little nell would die and readers wrote in begging for her to be saved
sentimentality accessibility topicality  what characterises todays soaps were clear features of the novel in 
both in the year of jubilee and esther waters for example centre on the burning s debate about marriage feminism and the new woman yet both are also tearjerkers which everyone enjoyed
the  books are compelling because they prefigure our own times and yet are set back from them
trilby is a tale of hypnotism and the unconscious a decade away from freud the ebb tide paved the way for conrads heart of darkness and the first questioning of colonial oppression
it is unlikely that the  booker choices will speak as eloquently of new trends today
whereas the  titles had contemporary settings many of the  books are historical such as paradise or are driven by nostalgia such as beside the ocean of time
which book will win on october 
stevenson will get the sympathy vote because he died in  in samoa the setting of the ebb tide
jungle book will get the retrospective vote because it is the bestknown today and has fashionable mythic overtones in the lost paradise of mowglis jungle its position on the list may also rescue it from schmaltzy disney associations and confirm it as a serious novel about a young mans selfdiscovery
my vote goes to trilby
softfocus ideologically shaky  in its antisemitic portrait of svengali  and sometimes sloppy it is a story of demonic possession and haunts the imagination like a fairy tale long after betterwritten works have faded from memory
like rebecca the popular novel by du mauriers granddaughter it is a natural equivalent of what the current booker prize seeks to create a combination of the classic and the bestseller
critic and novelist as byatt on tuesday won the booker prize britains most prestigious literary award for her tale of two young scholars investigating the lives of a pair of imaginary victorian poets
the five judges deliberated two hours before awarding the  prize to antonia byatt for possession one of six finalists in the yearold competition
last years booker winner was kazuo ishiguro for his novel the remains of the day
television executive sir denis forman chairman of the judges panel announced the prize at a banquet in londons elizabethan guildhall seat of the citys lord mayor
there was very strong individual support for several books on the short list and finally possession by as byatt was the winner by a majority vote said the judges
the panel was unanimous however in agreeing that the standard of the other five novels was exceptionally high and this made their decision unusually interesting and unusually difficult
ms byatt who earlier this month won the  irish timesaer lingus prize for international fiction for the same work has published five novels since 
in possession she tells how two graduate students piece together the relationship and lives of two imaginary victorian poets from fragments of their letters and by retracing the poets journeys across england and to france
the influence of the past on the living is a theme throughout the book
ms byatt born in  is the daughter of a lawyer and sister of novelist margaret drabble
her first novel shadow of a sun concerned the efforts of a woman to escape the shadow of her novelist father
a  work the virgin in the garden makes allegorical allusions to shakespeare and other english literary geniuses in a tale of a play performed at a country house
ms byatt taught english and american literature at university college in london until  when she quit to write fulltime
other finalists this year were  booker prize winner penelope fitzgerald with the gate of angels irish novelist john mcgaherns amongst women canadianborn mordecai richlers solomon gursky was here brian moores lies of silence and beryl bainbridges an awfully big adventure
they were chosen from a list of  books published in the united kingdom in 
the booker prize is sponsored by booker an international food and agriculture business and administered by the book trust
it is britains top literary award

the secessionist movement has been alternately simmering and flaring since  when the hindu ruler of the old princely state of kashmir faced with the option of merging either with india or islamic pakistan chose india
the two countries then were one year old having been partitioned from the british colonial india
india and pakistan have fought two wars over kashmir
they left the region split into the pakistanheld territory called azad kashmir or free kashmir and the indiancontrolled jammukashmir state
jammukashmir is the only state in india that is dominated by moslems
most of indias  million people are hindu

iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from thursdays massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the countrys islamic leadership say
the regime is very much fearful of public outrage said shahin gobadi spokesman for the peoples mojahedin of iran
theyre very much afraid of the political aftershocks
as gobadi spoke friday members of the organization denounced irans government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the white house
northern iran was stuck thursday by an earthquake measuring between  and  on the richter scale
iran has told the united nations that the death toll is at least  but gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 
gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring iraq and against internal opposition
they have been very late in assisting the people he said
sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting flagwaving rally participants who also carried signs criticizing their native country
planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake but part of the fridays activities focused on irans stricken residents
gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life
this regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery
this regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with iraq and to oppression of the people at home he said
a unsponsored ceasefire was declared last year after eight years of the iraniraq war
irans islamic republic was established in  after shah mohammad reza pahlavi was deposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and militants seized the us embassy in tehran taking  americans hostage
the united states broke diplomatic relations with iran in april 
the shah died in exile in july  us hostages were freed six months later and khomeini died last june
gobadi said his yearold group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the islamic republic
even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in iran rep mervyn dymally dcalif told an estimated  people attending the rally
there were many many victims before this tragedy and there are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of the united states he said
dymally a member of the house foreign affairs committee praised president bushs offer of humanitarian aid to iran but said bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through nongovernment groups
the state department said friday that iran was willing to accept earthquake relief from the american red cross and other us humanitarian organizations
spike lee may have been wearing a georgetown university cap and sweatshirt but he got a far warmer reception from syracuse university students than he did from academy award voters
in a lecture and questionandanswer session monday lee shrugged off the academys icy treatment of his latest movie do the right thing and blamed it on generational politics
the  film widely hailed by critics received only two academy award nominations and isnt being considered for best picture or best director
the academys membership consists mainly of old people the yearold lee said
he said they were a lot more comfortable with the black chauffeur in driving miss daisy than with the angry characters in his film
i still feel we made the best film of the year he said
asked if racism might have been involved in the academy nominations lee replied racisms involved in everything
despite the cap and sweatshirt syracuse students welcomed him as one of their own
hes an africanamerican one of the first ones to make it as a producer and director and hes addressing the issues and concerns affecting our community syracuse senior deron harris said
thats why were so proud of him

 the initial explosions on mount pinatubo at  am wednesday sent a milehigh mushroom cloud of swirling ash and rock fragments into the skies over clark air base forcing the air force to evacuate hundreds of american volunteers who had stayed behind to guard it and to tend sensitive communications equipment
 most of the  americans who live and work at clark were evacuated monday when scientists said it was clear that the volcano dormant for more than six centuries was returning to life
 us officials have refused to say whether nuclear weapons are stored at clark but they denied news reports suggesting a radiation danger if weapons depots on the base were hit by molten rock

defense secretary tom king said sunday he has issued an alert to all military installations to prevent other attacks
he would not give details
the perpetrators of the latest outrage are at large and there is a risk of other attacks king said
that is why we are taking a number of other steps
king defended the use of private security firms hired to guard the deal school and  other lowrisk military installations in britain
local residents and grieving relatives have said security was lax and should be turned back to the marines
king said the private firms will remain
it is important to remember that what we need in these cases are eyes and ears and observation king said on british broadcasting corp radio
private security guards can be a very useful additional assistance
they also help to reduce the amount of time soldiers have to spend on what is not the most enjoyable part of their activity

reality leaves a lot to the imagination
 john lennon
watching the new movie imagine john lennon was very painful for the late beatles wife yoko ono
the only reason why i did watch it to the end is because im responsible for it even though somebody else made it she said
cassettes film footage and other elements of the acclaimed movie were collected by ono
she also took cassettes of interviews by lennon which were edited in such a way that he narrates the picture
andrew solt this is elvis directed solt and david l wolper produced and solt and sam egan wrote it
i think this is really the definitive documentary of john lennons life ono said in an interview
what john was really about is depicted in this film very accurately and without whitewashing
i did view it
i didnt have them take any footage out
i wanted the truth
in the sense you had to put a year life into an hour and a half balance is a very serious consideration
i think they did a remarkable job and very tastefully so
there is a soundtrack album and a coffeetable book with comments primarily by lennon tied in with the film and using the same title
imagine theres no heaven its easy if you try no hell below us above us only sky imagine all the people living for today
 imagine is more than a lennon elegy
though it fails to delve too deeply into the darker side of lennon and the beatles drug use abusive tempers manager brian epsteins death it does capture the music and the times in which lennon lived
one intriguing episode in imagine shows cartoonist al capp lil abner being antagonistic toward the lennons during their bedin when they stayed in bed for a week to publicize their concern for peace
we were naive ono said
a lot of things happened because we were naive
maybe that was our strength
to us al capp was just a cartoonist and you naturally assume a cartoonist is liberal with a sense of humor
we didnt expect hostility
al capp is one incident that was filmed
in those days we did numerous interviews because of our stand for world peace
there were some very rough interviews
the hostility that was shown to us bluntly by reporters in those days was incredible
each time i think we were hurt
ono said lennon wrote the song imagine in  or 
we did the bedin the toronto peace festival the wars over billboard
he was saying we need an anthem for this whole concept of world peace
i think its one of the songs that will really go on forever in peoples minds
imagine theres no countries it isnt hard to do nothing to kill or die for and no religion too imagine all the people living life in peace  you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope someday youll join us and the world be as one
lennon was born oct  
he was shot and killed outside his manhattan apartment on dec  
ono was a painter when lennon met her
she later joined him in music and in public demonstrations for peace
i think that for somebody like me because i feel that im an artist and a creative artist that it is a very strange turn of events that im known as a widow she said
but it is stranger to me that im not that disturbed by it
i think that john promoted my work a lot in his lifetime and somehow it seems like it is a pleasure for me to sort of still work in a context of a partnership with him
i think it is my turn to promote him
he promoted me
when albert goldmans the lives of john lennon was published in september depicting the former beatle as riddled with vices faults and neuroses ono called it totally fiction
since then shes received a tremendous amount of support from friends and fans
i was very touched and thankful that people sent letters to me and extended hands at this time very warmly
i really appreciate that
i was also surprised that so many people stood up against it the goldman book
i didnt expect that ono said
lennons half sister julia baird also has written a new book john lennon my brother
she has no idea how many books have been written about lennon shes been sent some of them but hasnt read them
i know the life and it is too painful to read somebody elses version
theres still enough footage ono said for another movie  perhaps a music or political or art film
and theres another big john lennon project on her horizon
its from unpublished songs which were written for a broadway musical
i dont know if it would have gotten to broadway
you aim for the stars you know
the songs might be strung together
they might become a record might eventually become a musical
there are enough finished songs
they were never recorded in the studio
theyre on cassettes
their son sean  like his older halfbrother julian has become interested in music and started playing guitar
i had reservations about sean going into the music field
i still do
but i kind of gave up on it ono said
he is into guitar now
a session musician a very good one was teaching him
according to this teacher it seems like he is very good
he is just totally involved in it listening to eric clapton jimi hendrix his dads songs  only for guitar playing i think
he is into it so much good luck to him

iraq says it invaded kuwait at the request of a revolutionary organization there but diplomats dismiss that rationale as a largescale charade
the diplomatic world has remained largely unconviced by the flood of statements issued from iraq in the name of the provisional free kuwait government
britains un ambassador crispin tickell called the iraqi action an invasion from the outside  a phony coup detat from within
he said the invasion had led to the purported establishment of a puppet government
in a rare display of solidarity the united states and the soviet union called for iraq to withdraw and imposed sanctions
the un security council voted  to condemn the invasion
but iraqs deputy permanent un representative sabah talat kadrat said the security council should not be debating the issue because the fall of the kuwaiti emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah was an internal matter
the official kuwait news agency monitored in nicosia did not issue a single story all day
its computer periodically sputtered out the phrase line cut
on the other hand staterun iraqi news agency from baghdad came alive with a series of communiques from the provisional government
the members were not identified
the first statement said the provisional government finds that one of its primordial obligations is to remedy the harm done by the deposed corrupt government to our brothers in iraq
iraq has been feuding with kuwait over a border dispute
it has also accused kuwait of violating its oil production quotas set by the organization of petroleum exporting countries costing iraq of muchneeded revenues because oil is cheaper when supplies are higher
the statement on the iraqi news agency said the border dispute would be settled with fraternity and arab national interests indicating iraq would probably take the land it wants
the statement also said the alsabah family which had ruled kuwait for almost  years was working in concert with zionist and colonial powers to plot against iraq
that is the charge the iraqi press leveled at kuwait when tensions began to rise in midjuly
falsification of elections authoritarianism persecution of patriotic personalities have always been characteristics of the alsabah family the statement said
kuwait is one of the few arab states that has experimented with a freely elected parliament
a new national council with  members voted into office and  appointed by the emir took office after june elections
the communiques from the iraqi news agency said the national council has been disbanded
thousands of grieving friends and relatives of the fallen  crewmen from the battleship uss iowa gathered quietly monday and heard president bush praise their loved ones as brothers in eternity
we join today in mourning for the  who perished and in fact for the  who survived the president told a packed memorial service at norfolk naval air station
they all were in the words of a poet the men behind the guns
they came from hidalgo texas cleveland ohio tampa florida costa mesa california
they came to the navy as strangers served the navy as shipmates and friends and left the navy as brothers in eternity
in the finest navy tradition they served proudly on a great battleship the uss iowa
the president a world war ii navy pilot said he was proud to recommission the iowa in  and said it had earned  battle stars in two wars
but with the stillunexplained fire and explosion last wednesday in the battleships no
 gun turret he said fate has written a sorrowful chapter in the history of this great ship
the iowas commander capt
fred p moosally said the turrets crew was the best gun crew on the ship and called its chief  chief gunners mate reginald owen ziegler of port gibson ny  my no
 chief
victims relatives and hundreds of sailors and officers in dress blues were among the  people crowded into a hangar for the service
a bouquet of red roses was placed in front of the podium behind were an american flag and the battleships banners
outside another  people listened to the service on loudspeakers
as many as  iowa crewmen were unable to attend the service because they were delayed by traffic and were not permitted to enter the hangar because of security measures to protect bush
many were angry they could not attend said machinists mate david finn 
it was very important to them finn said
the service came a day after the world war iiera battleship eased into its home port its gun barrels scorched and its  crewmen at the rails in white uniforms and black armbands in memory of their dead shipmates
moosally told the crowd of mourners that he remembered the men of turret no
i remember their faces as they toiled at their guns sweating an honest sweat that comes from young men dedicated to a great cause he said
i remember as they talked among themselves looking so much like sailors of the past sharing the exuberance of the times and the dreams of the future he said
they were the life the spirit and the soul of our ship
they made the ultimate sacrifice for us
the men of turret two will be part of the spirit of the iowa forever
bush recounted seeing the iowa off the coast of the philippines as a naval aviator in world war ii and the great sense of confidence the big ship lent to the fleet
addressing the children of the victims he said you must never forget that your father was americas pride
at the end of the service while the navy hymn was played president and mrs bush greeted and consoled the families of the lost men
after the minute service the families attended a private reception with moosally
the navy said  victims families attended the service
at a press briefing following the reception moosally praised the hundreds of men who fought the fire for their courage
god gave birth to  heroes the captain said
fire on a ship is the most terrifying fear  you have nowhere to run
our extensive training paid off he said
besides the firefighting crews we had cooks engineers deck seamen marines all fighting to save the ship
moosally said the blast occurred just as he was turning to vice adm jerome johnson commander of the nd fleet to tell him to watch the no
 turret because it contained his best crew
this was my best turret moosally said
he said turret chief ziegler was the most meticulous of men
 chief of the  chiefs aboard
nobody in that turret did anything unless they were qualified moosally said
moosally refused to give a definite answer to reporters questions about whether the damaged turret could be repaired saying the battleship could operate without it if necessary
all but  men in the huge gun turret died almost instantly last wednesday when the explosion ripped through it
at the time the iowa was conducting open seas gun exercises off puerto rico
the navy said the investigation into the blast is continuing
navy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion
cmdr
john p morse the iowas weapons officer said the guns were thoroughly inspected the morning of the accident and moosally said he had no hesitation about the guns safety
ill be in the turret for the first shot to go off the captain said
one of the survivors gunners mate rd class kendall l truitt  of tampa fla said that at first the men down in the powder magazine in the lowest level of the turret didnt know anything was wrong
we were waiting for the gun to fire and we werent sure he said
when the men discovered that no one was answering the interior turret communications link truitt ordered the powder returned to the magazine and the compartment evacuated
the sailors found smoke everywhere as they climbed through hatches and up ladders outside the turret toward the sea deck truitt recalled
my first thought was that id better get to a lifeboat station because if the fire got to the magazine things would be bad he said
they also want to know why the ferry strayed outside standard navigational channels
the ton ship went down saturday night about six miles off the egyptian coast after ramming into a coral reef in stormy foot seas

whenever she was praised for i love lucy she invariably replied well all of the credit should go to writers madelyn pugh and bob carroll jr or desi was a genius he was responsible for the shows success
or she cited costars desi vivian vance and bill frawley
yes the writing and producing and casting of i love lucy were marvelous but lucys performance added the quantum force
her inspired pantomime could be written by no one the growing panic as the chocolate assembly line speeded up her catalog of pained expressions after tasting the patent medicine she was demonstrating
unlike many stars lucille ball rarely indulged in selfanalysis
but on one occasion she revealed why her feelings about the i love lucy triumph might have been ambivalent living through the last five years of the show she said took the edge off any enjoyment i might have had
desis drinking and carousing were a terrible embarrassment bad for a womans selfesteem
the talk around town was poor lucy
because i couldnt face people i became a recluse for more than  years
i never demonstrated my unhappiness at the studio and actually working together was a blessing
desi had everything so well organized that it was easy to do the work
lucy was late in reaching her comedy potential
she was  when i love lucy started on cbs and revolutionized television
and although she spent many years in hollywood none of the studios ever designed comedies for me the way mgm did for red skelton paramount did for bob hope and sam goldwyn did for danny kaye she once said
television was the medium for me the medium for anyone who wanted to be well known a lot faster than waiting a year and a half for a movie to come out she said in an interview late in life
television is an instant barometer especially the way we did it
it was all new
nobody knew anything about television
nobody was there to say no dont do that its wrong
we never knew what was wrong and what was right
we were all feeling our way
desi was very innovative and very showmanshipconscious and was very intent on going ahead and doing it that sounds all right lets go
so we went
always the credit to someone else
but millions upon millions of television watchers know otherwise

the shower and thunderstorm activity that we see taking place around the hurricane itself is getting better organized more vigorous so we think its starting to strengthen said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in miami
sheets said the hurricanes sustained winds would certainly increase to   miles per hour

hundreds of homes were destroyed he said
on mexicos northern coast people were evacuated from fishing villages and towns into shelters in matamoros a city of  about  miles inland near brownsville
the hurricane center said gilbert at one point was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure which was measured tuesday at  inches breaking the  inches recorded for the  hurricane that devastated the florida keys
the storm spawned saturday southeast of puerto rico appeared to have hit jamaica the hardest
seaga said it destroyed about  of jamaicas  homes
he estimated damage at  billion
seaga said in a nationwide radio broadcast thursday that the onemonth period of public emergency including a dawntodusk curfew to prevent looting was put into effect to enable normalcy to resume in the shortest possible time and to allow the rebuilding process to begin

a strong earthquake hit the himalayan kingdom of nepal and parts of eastern india on sunday morning triggering landslides and collapsing buildings
first reports said  people may have died
nepals department of geology said the earthquake struck at  am  pm edt saturday and measured  on the richter scale
the department said the quake was centered near udayapur a town near the indiannepalese border and  miles southeast of katmandu nepals capital
officials said the temblor lasted about  seconds
in new delhi the seismologoical observatory said the quake measured  on the richter scale
the staterun radio nepal said at least  people were killed in the towns of bhaktapur and dharan when they were buried by collapsing houses
press trust of india news agency said that in addition to  feared dead in india and nepal  people were injured in the indian states of bihar sikkim and west bengal
a nepalese journalist in dharan  miles southeast of katmandu said by telephone that  people have already died
a large number of injured were being taken to local hospitals and a rescue operation is under way
men of the royal nepal army police social workers and other local inhabitants are taking part in the rescue operation
the journalist added that  percent of the house of vijapur area of dharan collapsed
police reported seven people died in bhaktapur an ancient town seven miles east of katmandu while  others suffered injuries
the quake was also felt in the indian capital of new delhi and calcutta but there was no report of any casualties
one hardhit indian city was dharbhanga in bihar state where  children were believed killed when their school hostel collapsed
dharbhanga with a population of  is  miles east of new delhi
several homes in the residential areas of dharbhanga have collapsed killing an unspecified number of people
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph

most san franciscoarea homeowners may have to pay for damage from tuesdays earthquake out of their own pockets while insurance companies may reap longterm benefits from higher rates industry spokesmen and analysts said wednesday
only  percent to  percent of california homeowners have earthquake insurance which typically requires a  percent deductible and costs between  to  a year for a  home according to industry spokesmen
the association of california insurance cos in sacramento said that in the san francisco area roughly  to  percent of the homes have earthquake insurance
the organization estimated residential damages from tuesdays earthquake at  million in the bay area with between  million to  million insured
insured homeowners without earthquake protection will get reimbursed only if their homes were ravaged by fire which is covered under basic homeowner insurance polices said hugh strawn director of catastrophe services at the property loss research bureau in schaumburg ill insurance companies attempted wednesday to assess the amount of quakerelated damages theyre likely to have to pay
in addition to home damage the companies likely will get claims for automobile damage broken glass theft and burglary business interruption due to electrical outages water damage and possibly workers compensation
some estimated that insurers might face bills totaling  billion or more from the quake
but industry observers said they dont expect any company to suffer serious financial damage from quakerelated claims
we dont think any company is going to have problems paying claims said elisa siegal public affairs manager for the american insurance association a washingtonbased trade group
the insurers actually could benefit
industry analysts predicted insurers would be able to reverse three years of declining rates and win rate hikes from state regulators due to the quake damages and the estimated  billion in damages from hurricane hugo which hammered south carolina and other parts of the southeastern united states earlier this month
an increase in insurance rates could translate into greater profitability in the long term the analysts said
theres a perception that this could turn the cycle  that this could be enough to firm pricing said gloria l vogel an analyst with bear stearns  co inc in new york
despite their predictions for the long run the analysts warned that fourthquarter earnings among insurance companies are likely to be disappointing
its going to be a meaningful loss perhaps as big as hugo said robert glasspiegel an analyst with hartfordbased langen mcalenney
on the new york stock exchange some insurance company stock rose on wednesday
aetna life  casualty co rose  to  a share itt corp parent of the hartford was up  cents to  and the travelers cos rose  to 
reinsurance companies which absorb risk from policy writers did especially well
general re corp rose  to  and marsh  mclennan cos rose  to 
in california earthquake insurance is an emotional and politicallycharged issue
roughly twothirds of all insurance policies written in the united states are sold in california where many of the nations most damaging earthquakes have occurred
under a  california law insurers are required to offer earthquake insurance to homebuyers but homebuyers are not required to buy the coverage
insurers arent required to offer earthquake insurance to commercial property owners but the percentage of business property with the coverage is very high industry spokesmen said
they estimated that at least  percent and probably many more business properties are insured
because of its high costs earthquake insurance has become a target of the controversial proposition  approved by california voters last year
the proposition calls for a  percent rollback in insurance rates
insurers and state regulators are battling over the rates and how theyre set
soviet media once branded andrei d sakharov a traitor but a moscow weekly has now provided a sympathetic portrait of the human rights activist and his wife
this weeks issue of the newspaper moscow news said that sakharov long ago understood the need for change in the soviet union
the article makes a clear attempt to refute some of the past charges leveled at sakharov and his wife fellow dissident yelena bonner by soviet officials and the statecontrolled media
moscow news also pointedly notes that the  nobel peace prize winner has praised mikhail s gorbachevs campaign for social and economic reform
the yearold sakharov and his wife lead a frugal existence in their seventhfloor moscow apartment eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple fare and sakharov insists on washing the dishes afterward himself the paper said
it said their tworoom home was always filled with people seeking sakharovs aid and that the words most often heard there are help me
but moscow news asked can he really do everything
although the fullpage article was the longest on sakharov to date in the soviet press it made only indirect reference to the nearly seven years he spent in exile after criticizing the kremlins intervention in afghanistan
sakharov a brilliant physicist was allowed to return to moscow in december  from his forced residence in the closed city of gorky where he was banished without trial in january 
in effect sometimes sakharov bitterly jokes that hed like to return to gorky for a few months to be able to work alone on scientific work moscow news said
of course concerning gorky thats a bitter joke
since his return to moscow sakharov has been a vocal supporter of gorbachevs program for nationwide reforms that includes the policy of glasnost or greater openness on selected topics
he simply believes that something helped change the thoughts of the majority into state policy moscow news saidhe calls perestroika restructuring an enormous event for our country and for the entire world
however sakharov has insisted on speedier progress in improving the soviet record on human rights and during a jan  meeting in the kremlin he handed gorbachev a list of  people he said were imprisoned for their views
moscow news noted that in  in a tract titled knowledge and the world sakharov set forth his views on soviet affairs
those writings have not been published in the soviet union
now we can definitely see parallels between what he said then and those ideas that we are putting forward today moscow news said
sakharov called for a ban on nuclear testing long before the kremlin
the human rights activist one of the most prominent members of the dissident movement that reached its peak in the s sought openness in soviet society years before glasnost became communist party policy
much of the moscow news article seemed designed to undo harm caused to the sakharovs by previous press campaigns against them
it said one soviet book accused the sakharovs of living in oriental luxury and engaging in scandals between spouses
moscow news said sakharov was stubborn unassuming an undisputed member of his countrys intelligentsia and a man with his own views on how to deal conscientiously with world affairs and the demands of this life
his strong convictions even extend to his insistence that he do the dishes after meals wrote the reporter who visited sakharov at his apartment
what is that andrei dmitrievich your hobby
asked moscow news correspondent gennady zhavoronkov
not all guests are able to wash the dishes conscientiously sakharov replied
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev and prime minister margaret thatcher today argued passionately during a fourhour meeting that covered subjects ranging from disarmament to reports of soviet bomber sales to libya officials said
reopening a european peace offensive that was disrupted by the armenian earthquake gorbachev had extremely frank exchanges animated warm passionate and solemn said a thatcher spokesman requesting anonymity
gorbachev also hit the streets of london stopping his motorcade to shake hands with about  people in a crowd of several hundred who cheered him outside westminster abbey
the thatcher spokesman said the soviet leader and the staunchly anticommunist prime minister love arguing
emerging from her  downing st residence into the icy rain with gorbachev at her side thatcher told reporters the talks have been very deep very wide ranging and very friendly and as always we got to grips with the real issues
the spokesman said thatcher asked gorbachev about a report from washington that moscow sold up to  longrange fighterbombers to libya which britain accuses of sponsoring terrorism
gorbachev did not respond he said
although the two leaders could make no progress on the bomber issue the spokesman said the soviet and british foreign ministers meeting separately would most likely discuss the matter at length
he said thatcher also accused the soviets of having been not as frank as they should be about their chemical weapons arsenal
he quoted gorbachev as replying if you arent fully satisfied then quite clearly we have to have more exchanges
we have got to try better to convince each other
another area of disagreement was gorbachevs goal of eliminating all nuclear weapons from europe
thatcher believes the deterrence of nuclear weapons prevents war
weather experts discussed the drought thursday and its possible causes and effects and said they hoped to produce a consensus on how much longer it will last
all of the speakers at the  drought symposium called for more research and study
theres an enormous number of possibilities that one could chase
the next business of the scientist is to eliminate the possibilities of  and extend the range of analysis and look for cause and effect said david rodenhuis director of the federal climate analysis center in washington
the symposium attended by  state and national experts was sponsored by the weather channel an atlantabased cable network which broadcast the meeting live
john hope the networks hurricane specialist and a former forecaster with the national hurricane center in miami fla said the drought in the southeast might be lessened or ended in the next few months by a heavier than normal hurricane season
hope said current weather conditions point to more tropical storms more of which should become hurricanes in this hurricane season
he stressed that a hurricanes effect on drought is variable depending on the intensity and speed of the storm
nevertheless he said some southeastern states get as much as  pecent of their rainfall in some months from hurricanes
georgia state climatologist gayther plummer told the symposium he thought the position of the planet jupiter had something to do with drought in the southeast
however rodenhuis said he was skeptical about plummers thesis
its very necessary to be cautious and analytical about the issue he said
ferries are among the safest vessels afloat
but as the tragic sinking of the estonia with the loss of more than  lives demonstrates when they do go down the toll in human life can be high
as ferries increase in size so the numbers on board at risk from mechanical failure or a crew error go up
the move to rollon rolloff ferries with vehicle decks which run the entire length of the vessel has increased the risk that once the sea penetrates the hold through the bow doors or a gash in the ships side it can lead to the vessel capsizing
the united nations international maritime organisation imo and its members the shipowning nations have devoted much thought over the past two decades to ship safety
but the sinking of the estonia should lead to a new review of ferry safety
particularly worrying are the eyewitness reports which suggest that water penetrated the bow doors in a manner reminiscent of the sinking of the herald of free enterprise in 
unlike the herald the estonia appears to have had its doors closed but roros are undoubtedly very vulnerable to water penetration
any review of ferry safety should focus on three main issues
first the subject of ferry design should be reconsidered
additional stability could be provided by the addition of sponsons stabilising bulges which project from the ships side just above the water line
greater resistance to an influx of water could be obtained by installing moveable barriers or bulkheads to break up the large car decks
these proposals were looked at by the british government in the wake of the sinking of the herald of free enterprise
it calculated that it would cost between pounds m and pounds m to improve standards on the  vessels in the uk ferry fleet with a further pounds m in extra annual running costs
higher costs would inevitably lead to higher fares  unwelcome to ferry operators when on the short crosschannel routes they face competition from the channel tunnel
but the difficulty of pushing through fare rises would be nothing like as damaging to the ferry companies as another disaster
second the imo and national governments must look closely at how to improve enforcement of existing regulations
the imo has been trying to move enforcement up its agenda but it depends on the good will and professionalism of governments and shipowners
third the imo should be given support by national governments in its campaign launched yesterday to improve crew training
much of the regulation in recent years has concentrated on improving the ship and its equipment
above all if new regulation does turn out to be necessary it must be introduced speedily
as things stand it can take years before changes are ratified by enough governments to give them force
the european union which sweden and finland are getting ready to join could take a lead in speeding up the process
ship safety is not of course just an issue for the ferry sector
five small ferries were lost last year according to lloyds register
but this figure pales into insignificance compared with the  general cargo ships and  tankers which also went down
when a cargo vessel with a thirdworld crew goes down in a distant ocean very little attention is paid
if the loss of a relatively modern passenger vessel in european waters can make shipping safety a higher priority for governments and the public this will be some small compensation for the loss of life from the estonia
president bush embargoed all trade with iraq and froze the nations assets in the united states on thursday while refusing to rule out the use of us troops to rescue kuwait from its iraqi invaders
the trade embargo bars imports of oil from iraq which account for  to  of total us oil supplies officials said
the move also prohibits iraq from buying us grain and other foodstuffs which represent the other chief element of trade between the two nations
iraqs naked aggression against kuwait has created an emergency in the persian gulf bush said in a speech to the aspen institute a nonprofit organization that focuses on global issues
the united states he said would insist on immediate and unconditional withdrawal of iraqi troops
referring to iraqi president saddam hussein bush declared we find his behavior intolerable
the trade embargo represents the strongest international response so far to iraqs massive invasion of its small and poorly defended neighbor but it stopped short of the military intervention requested by desperate kuwait officials
but according to bush administration sources the pentagon stepped up air patrols in the persian gulf and began moving warships equipment and supplies into the area in a signal to iraq that the united states would act to halt further aggression
a second executive order signed by the president early thursday froze kuwaits assets in the united states a step taken to prevent iraq from seizing kuwaiti property
we expect our friends to stand by us in our time of need kuwaits ambassador to the united states sheik saud al nasir al sabah said at a washington news conference
i think the us intervention at this stage is both paramount and important
however iraqs ambassador to washington mohammed al mashat said iraq had invaded kuwait in response to a request from the nations interim free government
he warned the west not to consider any foreign interference in the current events
iraqs explanation was quickly denounced by the state department which said baghdads claim that its troops moved into kuwait at that countrys request is patent fraud
in a related development the state department confirmed that invading iraqi troops had rounded up six american oil field workers near the border of kuwait
their whereabouts is not known
despite bushs refusal to rule out military action it appeared an unlikely option given the strength of iraqs military the limited us forces in the region and the opposition to us intervention from other countries in the area
officials said the bush administrations energies are focused mainly on organizing international economic and diplomatic pressure against iraq
even so the strongest economic weapon an international ban on iraqi oil exports also appears unlikely to be employed
at a joint news conference with british prime minister margaret thatcher who is scheduled to give a speech to the nonprofit aspen institute on sunday bush said that secretary of state james a baker iii will discuss the persian gulf situation with soviet officials in moscow today
in ulan bator mongolia where baker was on an asian visit a baker spokeswoman said that the united states and the soviet union plan to issue a joint statement later today condemning the iraqi invasion of kuwait
baker will meet with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze on a brief refueling stop in moscow
the meeting was arranged after baker met with the soviet ambassador to mongolia who described the kremlins plans for a strong soviet stand on the invasion
baker at a news conference in ulan bator early today said there have been no reports of us casualties in kuwait and that the integrity of foreign embassies seems to have been preserved so far
he said the estimate of the number of iraqi troops in kuwait varies from  to 
bush flew to colorado after meeting early in the morning with his national security council to discuss the persian gulf situation
originally the president had planned to spend the night in colorado and return to washington today
instead he returned to washington on thursday night
before leaving the capital thursday morning bush told reporters at the white house that he was not contemplating any us military involvement
but later in the day at the news conference with thatcher bush moved away from that pledge
he said that he had met during the day with top defense advisers and were not ruling any options out
the trade embargo imposed by bush would cut off all commerce with iraq except news reporting exports of publications and shipments of emergency relief supplies of food and medicine
like bush thatcher has frozen iraqi and kuwaiti assets but she has not imposed a trade embargo
iraq is highly dependent on oil exports to finance its large armed forces and considerable national debt
but europe and japan are far more dependent on middle eastern oil than is the united states and an international oil embargo on iraq would be painful for many us allies
at the joint news conference thatcher called for un actions to impose additional trade sanctions against iraq
asked about an oil embargo however she stopped short
we are prepared to support in the un security council those measures which collectively we can agree to and which collectively we can make effective she said
those are the two tests
bush spent the day discussing the iraqi invasion with senior advisers and other heads of state including the heads of egypt yemen and jordan arab leaders whom the president described as friends of the united states
the arab leaders bush said had appealed to him for restraint and a short period of time in which to develop an arab solution
bush expressed sympathy with the arab effort but added that i made clear to them that it had gone beyond simply a regional dispute
later thursday the white house said that bush had spoken with king fahd of saudi arabia for about  minutes
the statement said the two leaders agreed that the invasion was unacceptable and discussed possible options for dealing with the situation
at a news conference in washington kuwaiti ambassador saud appealed to the united states for military assistance
my people are suffering saud said adding that kuwait is requesting aid from everyone who has conscience and fair play around this world
referring to kuwaits request for us military intervention he said we dont stand a chance if we dont get aid from our friends
mashat baghdads ambassador to the united states said in a statement given to reporters in washington that iraq hoped to withdraw its forces within a few days or weeks
the events currently occurring in kuwait are an internal affair with which iraq has no relation mashat said
meanwhile the united states asked iraq to account for the six missing american oil company employees in kuwait
times staff writers maura reynolds michael ross and don shannon in washington and jim mann in ulan bator mongolia contributed to this story
more on invasion us
forces shifted  us warships and planes deploy quickly to the troubled area
but american options are limited
a no major impact  the broad embargo that bush imposed on iraq is not expected to have a major impact on its economy
a an arab dilemma  arab ministers in disarray cannot agree on a response to the crisis
a market pounded  the stock market was rocked by iraqs invasion of kuwait the dow slid 
coalminers from romanias jiu valley who spearheaded violent antireform rampages through bucharest in  and  are once again out on strike pressing the government for higher wages
but so far the government unlike its predecessors has not caved in
it has instead begun legal action to have the strike which today entered its second week declared illegal
the miners position seems untenable
romanians appear solidly opposed to the strike angered by the miners demands for an average wage of the equivalent of dollars  a month
most workers earn less than dollars 
workers in the same trade union confederation as the miners have ignored appeals by their leaders to strike in solidarity
the ministry of industry argues that the m tonnes of pit coal produced each year in the jiu valleys  mines is not a vital source of energy
the regions coal supplies two nearby power stations but these plants which together account for only  per cent of the countrys electricity capacity could also be run using lignite and gas
the ministry further argues that the miners are in danger of pricing their coal out of the market
according to the ministry if the miners pay demands were met the cost of their coal would double
even at present prices ukrainian coal is being imported to the romanian market
the strike seems motivated by a number of factors
the rank and file have come out because they want more money to compensate for the difficult conditions in which they live and work
they are also following the call of their charismatic leader mr miron cosma the man who led them on protests to bucharest and secured their earlier wage increases
mr cosmas motive for calling the strike  for which surprisingly he has the support of rah the stateowned coal mining company  are less obvious
the ministries of industry and finance are conducting investigations into charges of fraud and embezzlement by mr cosma and several senior rah company officials
the companys chief accountant and budget director have already been fired following earlier investigations
ministry of industry officials argue the strike could be an attempt to divert attention from the investigations
mr cosma however appears confident
one of his bargaining tools is the threat albeit veiled of fresh violence
in response to the question as to whether he intends to lead his men who appear to support him wholeheartedly to bucharest again he says with miners anything is possible
but he is also making political threats
in recent months mr cosma has claimed he has evidence that senior government officials including president ion iliescu called miners to bucharest as part of plans to consolidate their own power
mr cosma appears increasingly willing to talk if his demands are not met
it remains to be seen whether those involved in the incidents of  and  now feel confident enough to ignore him
pakistani troops fired on indian security forces who stopped a mob of pakistani protesters from storming across the border into disputed kashmir officials said today
at least three demonstrators were killed sunday night a defense ministry spokesman said in islamabad
pakistans staterun tv said the indian guards killed as many as six
the trouble started after indian border guards opened fire on hundreds of pakistanis who tried to cross a ceasefire line separating pakistancontrolled kashmir from the indianheld region
a spokesman for the indian defense ministry said pakistani troops then fired about  rounds from light and medium weapons at indian border posts in the uri sector
indian forces returned fire and the exchange continued for about half an hour the spokesman said
no one was hurt
a pakistani official in islamabad denied the accusations
pakistani military authorities and the foreign secretary are in touch with indian authorities to remove the misunderstanding said additional foreign secretary khalid mahmood in islamabad
pakistans top diplomat in new delhi bashir babar was summoned to indias foreign ministry on sunday and today and apprised of indias concern over the events an indian government spokesman said
a fluid mile ceasefire line separates the indian and pakistani kashmirs
pakistan and indian twice have gone to war over kashmir in  and again in 
on feb  at least one person was killed and  wounded when pakistani mobs tried to cross the ceasefire line near jammu  miles to the south
the two demonstrations at the ceasefire line were to express support for moslem militants who are fighting for independence for the moslemdominated state from the predominantly hindu india
on sunday the pakistani mob retreated when soldiers of indias paramilitary border security force opened fire said the indian spokesman who refused to be identified
the mob returned a second time by which time it had become slightly dark he said
that is when the pakistani troops opened fire
a pakistani spokesman who also refused to be identified said pakistani army patrols repulsed a mob of some  demonstrators
small groups broke away from the crowd and slipped into the indianheld territory he said
an official of the indian border security force which normally patrols the border said the indian army today took control of the ceasefire line
some men in the intruding crowd were armed with guns which they fired occasionally he said
it was becoming very difficult our troops had to open fire he said
farouk haider vicepresident of the militant jammukashmir liberation front that is leading the uprising said in islamabad after the indian firing that the situation is very confusing
thirtyone people were wounded in the shooting haider said
five were in critical condition in a hospital in muzzafarabad the capital of pakistancontrolled kashmir he said adding he knew of only one death
the yearold conflict over kashmir flared jan  after a government crackdown and the arrest of  suspected militants
most of them were subsequently released but the arrests sparked widespread violence
at least  people have been killed since the crackdown began
most of the victims have been curfewbreaking protesters shot by security forces in srinagar
srinagar the summer capital of jammukashmir has been the center of the secessionist movement that has turned violent in recent years
the jammukashmir liberation front had earlier campaigned for union with islamic pakistan but has in recent years demanded independence and the status of a neutral country
about  percent of jammukashmirs  million people are moslems making it the only moslem majority state in predominantly hindu indias  states
nationwide moslems make up  percent of indias  million population
hindus comprise  percent

other observances were held from liverpool to moscow to los angeles
in lennons hometown in england fans gathered at the former site of the cavern club where the beatles were discovered
among those attending was lennons yearold uncle charlie lennon
when asked how his nephew would have reacted to the ceremonies he said if he had been alive i doubt he would have come and even if he had he would sat with me in the pub and had a good laugh
on the west coast about  people  part of an estimated  billion people worldwide who had access to the event  stood near lennons star on the walk of fame and listened to the imagine broadcast imagine all the people living life in peace you may say im a dreamer but im not the only one i hope some day youll join us and the world will live as one
his spirit still lives in all of us whose lives have been touched with him ono said of her late husband
i would like us to remember and celebrate his birthday as a day of love because he was a man of love and because love is much needed at this time in our lives
ono was greeted by marcela perez de cuellar wife of the un secretarygeneral

more than  radio stations and networks from  countries broadcast the minute event
us armed forces television and radio beamed it to plus other countries
mtv televised the imagine video in  countries said andrea smith a spokeswoman for the network
in moscow about  soviets gathered at the moscow electrical lamp factorys cultural hall to listen to lennons music snap up his albums and posters and reflect on his life

lennon was shot to death by a deranged fan outside his manhattan apartment building on dec  
the summer olympics will be remembered for moments of glory like that enjoyed by us diver greg louganis and the startling moment of disgrace when the gold was stripped from canadian sprinter ben johnson
the soviet union won the first ussoviet olympic medal contest since  getting  gold medals to  for east germany and  for the united states
host south korea rose to fourth in the world with  golds
the fear of terrorism and massive civil unrest prompted extraordinary security but neither bogey materialized as nearly  athletes from  countries tested their mettle in  days of competition ended sunday
as always there were shining moments of glory from an opening ceremony with exotic dancers and parachutists to a closing with hugs and tears fireworks and dances and the mascots of seoul and barcelona the site of the  games floating together into the starry night
louganis claimed his second pair of gold medals after hitting his head on a springboard
he said he talked with his coach about quitting the olympics after hitting the board and opening a cut that needed five stitches to close
we walked and discussed all the things we had gone through to get there he said
i decided to stay in and im glad i did
louganis said sunday he is retiring from diving to begin an acting career
what had been the highest moment of the games  ben johnson rocketing to victory over us great carl lewis in a meter dash world record  led to the deepest pain when the canadian was caught cheating with musclebuilding anabolic steroids
twenty years from now when most of the records set in seoul are broken the impact of johnsons disgrace will still be felt if athletes and trainers heed the events here and end doping
there have been high points and some low points and the most important low point was ben johnson juan antonio samaranch president of the international olympic committee said today
that was indeed a blow
but catching johnson and expelling him and nine other athletes with positive drug tests was an indication that we have won the battle against doping samaranch said
sports officials from the united states and the soviet union on sunday announced sunday they would join forces to work towards the elimination of drugs from sport
a statement issued by the us and soviet olympic committees said the groups would investigate using the exchange of testing teams lab results and technical data education programs and uniform penalties
for the united states a serious problem at the seoul games was a rising tide of antiamerican sentiment
it was exacerbated by nbcs coverage which the koreans saw as antikorean and insensitive to local culture the arrest of several american athletes and the perceived rudeness of the us team at the opening ceremony
the soviets meanwhile cultivated friendship by bringing in the bolshoi ballet the moscow philharmonic films a photo exhibit and copies of the communist party newspaper pravda
the announcement of an unprecedented sports exchange program between south korea and the soviet union and the arrival of the first soviet diplomats since world war ii also warmed relations
soviet athletes as they did in calgary canada during the winter games made a special effort to meet with local people
american athletes tended to isolate themselves
all those differences became apparent at the sporting events where koreans often cheered louder for the soviets or east germans than they did for americans despite a close year relationship with the united states
still there were louganis and other americans to unabashedly cheer for  like sistersinlaw florence griffith joyner and jackie joynerkersee who led an assault on the track and field record books and louganis
griffith joyner won golds in the  the  and the meter relay and silver in the meter relay
she set a world record in the  and an olympic record in the 
joynerkersee won two golds taking the heptathlon with a world record  points and the long jump with an olympic mark of  feet  inches

the expensive practice of using balloon catheters to force open heart arteries immediately after heart attacks now routinely done at many large hospitals is unnecessary and should be abandoned according to a major study released tuesday
the study found that if heart attack victims quickly receive clotdissolving drugs they usually dont need the extra step of the common balloon procedure known as angioplasty
some experts said the results are good news because they mean that most heart attack patients can be treated in community hospitals where angioplasty is not available
the study also has an important financial message
its authors estimated that if angioplasty was widely adopted after heart attacks it could raise the nations annual medical bills by  million
this trial has settled one of the most important questions in modernday cardiology commented dr j
ward kennedy of the university of washington seattle
the study is phase  of the thrombolysis in miocardial infarction trial or timiii directed by dr eugene braunwald of brigham and womens hospital in boston
the first phase of the study showed that giving people a clotdissolving drug called tissue plasminogen activator or tpa immediately after heart attacks dramatically improved their chances of survival
the latest study presented at the annual meeting of the american heart association was intended to see whether people did better still if doctors tried to clear away any remaining blockages after giving tpa
at  hospitals across the united states doctors randomly assigned  patients to get angioplasty within two days of their heart attacks if tests showed there was any chance they might benefit
sixty percent of them actually underwent the procedure which temporarily inflates balloons in dangerously narrowed heart arteries to squeeze them open
a comparison group of  also got tpa
but they were not considered for angioplasty unless they had lingering heart pain or abnormal exercise tests during their recovery
after  days  percent of those in the angioplasty group had died or suffered further heart attacks as did  percent of those in the comparison group
a year after the treatment there was no difference in survival
about  percent of both groups were still alive
there does not appear to be any additional benefit from angioplasty braunwald said
dr thomas j ryan of boston university medical center commented we have the answer in this trial to a very important question of health care delivery
while small hospitals can give clotdissolving drugs to heart attack patients most of them do not have the sophisticated labs where angioplasty is performed
if the study had found that immediate angioplasty improves survival it would have meant that many more angioplasty labs would need to be established and more doctors trained to give the procedure
the watch word is watchful waiting to see if patients need angioplasty
this ultimately makes it possible for patients to be treated in community hospitals and be transfered to terciary care centers if angioplasty is needed said dr howard morgan immediate past president of the heart association
heart attacks occur when a clot blocks an artery that feeds the heart muscle
the purpose of tpa and similar drugs is to dissolve these clots before the muscle dies
to be effective the drugs must be given within about four hours of the start of heart attack symptoms
experts say that only about  percent of heart attack victims are considered to be candidates for the drugs
many people delay going to the hospital until permanent damage occurs
in others the treatment may be considered too dangerous because of recent surgery or a history of strokes
balloon angioplasty is also widely used to treat people with clogged heart arteries who have not suffered heart attacks
the latest study did not question the usefulness of this kind of angioplasty
i assume that anyone who was ever touched by the genius of leonard bernstein will have his own memory of the renaissance man of music as you aptly described him part a oct 
mine dates back to october  when i was serving as an american volunteer in the israeli army during the countrys war of independence
with a twoday pass in hand i hitchhiked to jerusalem where the israeli equivalent of the uso scrounged up a ticket for the evenings performance of the israel philharmonic with bernstein as the guest conductor
the audience was a mix of blacktie patrons and soldiers dressed in fatigues
bernstein raised the baton for beethovens fifth symphony emotional at any time but never more so than for a people engaged in a lifeanddeath struggle
toward the end of the first movement machinegun fire started crackling from the old city held by the jordanian legion and continued intermittently through the rest of the symphony
what would have been a distracting disturbance at any other time melded with the music as entirely appropriate to the mood and circumstances of the occasion
lenny and the orchestra never missed a beat

as one of the worlds finest smallbore freerifle shooters he is coming close
bakes  set a world record in the kneeling portion of the threeposition rifle competition friday en route to a gold medal at the  world cup usa olympicstyle shooting tournament at petersens prado tiro ranges in chino
by scoring  of a possible  points bakes broke the record set last week in mexico city by yugoslavias rajmond debevec
the event includes  total shots in three positions  prone standing and kneeling
bakes once held the record for standing too but that was four years ago
he has yet to hold the prone record but his  in that discipline helped him take a big lead in one of three medal events friday
counting the shot shootoff bakes finished with  points out of

bakes a lieutenant in the czech army said he was confident after his kneeling performance that he would do well
in the days closest competition francoise decharne of moulin france won the womens air rifle competition with a total of  of a possible 
soon young jin of south korea was second and deena wigger of murray ky was third
wigger was second after the regular competition ended but fell  of a point behind jin in a shot final round
all international events have added the final round to increase television and spectator interest
the top eight shooters in pistol rifle and air events qualify whereas the top six advance in shotgun events

hyun joo bang of south korea was second and margit stein of west germany was third
sekaric  held a ninepoint lead going into the final round
my final was not so good she said
i had too big of a lead
i usually shoot better in these finals when i am pressed
despite her lapse she still won by  points over bang perhaps the most appropriately named competitor in this tournament featuring  countries

friday was her best international performance
amid the uproar of live coverage by the major networks and scores of other media organizations national hurricane center forecasters went about their business of monitoring hurricane hugo
the whole system looks chaotic but it works said bob sheets the centers director
on one side of a large room dominated by a ushaped bank of monitoring equipment were the forecasters making meticulous calculations about where the deadly hurricane will strike and getting emergency operations going in those areas
on the other side were the media  a pack of reporters camera operators and technicians jockeying for seconds of sheets time and tidbits of his expertise
in the center was sheets himself
surrounded by cameras wires and two dozen journalists with pads and telephones the ubiquitous redheaded meteorologist has appeared on television all week next to a large satellite monitor showing colorful images of hurricane hugo
during prime news time competing technicians and cameramen shout and make rude hand gestures for people to get out of their shots of sheets
at his back casually dressed forecasters who have been working hour days tracked the storm via computers and satellites
we obviously dont like this and could probably do a better job but everyone knows now because of the media said hurricane specialist max mayfield
in the caribbean we were not so certain the word got out
but we know the carolinas have been evacuated
when a hurricane warning goes into effect its a  million statement said meteorologist joel cline referring to the cost of emergency preparations and evacuation plans that must be implemented when the warning is posted
if we werent here then you wouldnt know that a storm was out there he said
before the hurricane warning system was established a storm of hugos power would have cost thousands of lives
but early today after days of warnings and proper evacuation procedures there were no immediate reports of deaths despite widespread damage in charleston and other coastal areas of south carolina
i like to think that we make a difference a far as human lives are concerned cline said
after hugos landfall sheets and the other forecasters began to wind down from the hectic pace they had maintained for the last several days
but he warned the hurricane center still is following three other weather systems that have moved into the atlantic between the united states and africa and another storm in the pacific
i hate to say were breathing a sigh of relief because people are getting clobbered to death meteorologist mark zimmer said as the storm pounded charleston sc but weve done all we can
dan quayle is likely to be a man on the outside in george bushs white house following a vice presidential candidacy that began in a furor but settled into obscurity experts say
encumbered by his image as a political novice who needed a bevy of professional handlers to survive early campaign controversies quayle enters a bush administration in which he has few intimates or allies
relegated in the campaign to small towns and safe gop areas quayle as vice president is likely to be given a traditional ceremonial role  going to political gatherings and state funerals  rather than the advisory role that walter mondale and even bush had some scholars feel
dan quayle is going to set the vice presidency back about a decade or more
one thing that political scientists have been talking about is just how much the vice presidency has grown
 with quayle its just going to retreat to the old days of politics and funerals said ryan barilleaux a professor of political science at miami university in oxford ohio who studies the american presidency
bush rarely mentioned his yearold running mate during the campaign
when asked bush employed the stock lines that quayle would make an outstanding vice president and had been tempered by steel as he weathered the early furor over his military service academic record and personal life
the presidentelect told reporters quayle would have access to the same papers information and intelligence that is available to the president
but he would go no further in describing what assignments he would give quayle
quayle says bush has talked to him about heading a space council and that he assumes hell have a role in the administrations antidrug efforts
i will be a very close adviser to the president quayle said
but thats not the way everyone sees it
both bush and mondale came to their vice presidential campaigns with substantial reputations and were able to place key staffers in important positions in the respective presidential campaigns barilleaux notes
dan quayle has contributed nothing in the way of staff to the bush campaign
he doesnt have his own big reputation on capitol hill
 dan quayle has no friends in a bush white house except george bush barilleaux says
theyre going to give him a lot of window dressing a space council drug task force but hes going to be a man on the outside  not a man whos going to be consulted in a crisis except on a pro forma basis
but eddie mahe jr a gop consultant who worked with the bush campaign says bush is likely to give quayle a more active role in the administration than he had in the campaign
vindication demands that
both of them will want to prove how right the decision was mahe says
democrats portrayed quayle during the campaign as a lightweight a man with little or no legislative accomplishments untested and unqualified to be a heartbeat away from the presidency
even some members of quayles own party were dismayed at bushs choice
quayle didnt help his case by making a number of celebrated gaffes during the campaign perhaps the worst being his garbled explanation of the holocaust and his declaration i didnt live in this century
norman ornstein of the american enterprise institute says quayle while not the worlds leading intellectual is not a complete dummy
he was simply thrust into a situation for which he was unprepared ornstein says
i think hes immature
hes not stupid ornstein says
but quayle comes to the white house with a very damaging stereotype thats developed about him thats widely believed in the political community and thats believed by a large segment of the electorate ornstein says
thats going to give him a good deal to overcome
its going to give him an enormous impetus to prove himself
thats going to be difficult given the office
both barilleaux and stephen hess of the brookings institution see parallels in quayles vice presidency and those of richard nixon and spiro agnew
the choice of nixon was viewed as a move by dwight eisenhower to appease the partys right wing and agnew was seen as a political nonentity
the natural response is to use him quayle sparingly as nixon did with agnew in  hess says
however quayle has four years to prove himself and i think youre going to see stories in two years about how much hes learned how much hes acted responsibly how far hes come from the campaign of 
quayle admits the campaign was a learning process
after the controversies subsided quayle declared his independence from his bush handlers saying he would be his own man
he became more accessible to the media but continued to adhere to the schedule handed down from washington and to deliver the partys scripted message
soon he dropped off the front pages
and although he occasionally spoke out in frustration at having little control over his schedule and at ceasing to make national news he played the role of loyal no
 and even trumpeted his new anonymity
we have arrived as being a traditional vice presidential nominee because we are either on the back pages or either not on the pages at all
thats what were supposed to be he told reporters
that willingness to be a team player could serve him well in a bush white house mahe feels since bush wants a private adviser whose experience and opinion he respected  who has never had another agenda
dan quayle owes his political life to one man and one man alone mahe says
youre never going to see dan quayle telling tales out of school

 scientists warned of more possibly larger eruptions from the foot volcano which was dormant for six centuries until it began spewing steam in april
 this could be only the beginning said raymundo punongbayan director of the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology
 angeles a city of  is adjacent to clark air base but authorities had not ordered a general evacuation there
 hundreds of americans fled clark home to  american military personnel and their families
most of the bases residents had been evacuated monday
the base did not appear immediately threatened by volcanic flow
 seismologists said searing gas ash and molten rock raced at great speed down the mountains western and northern slopes
they said most of the debris flowed into the marella maraunot and odonnell rivers and that there had been no reports that property or homes had been damaged
 about  aeta tribesman descendants of the original inhabitants of the philippines fled the slopes of mount pinatubo
 at a refugee center in olongapo  miles southwest of the volcano survivors told of the sky growing dark then of hearing a tremendous explosion followed by a rain of ash
 they said they scampered for safety with their belongings and livestock over roads slippery with ashfall many wearing cardboard boxes to protect themselves from the ash
 they were stunned by the eruption television reporter bert basa said
their faces turned ashen and it looked like their hair was standing on end
 ash was so thick in the air that at noon motorists were driving with their headlights and windshield wipers on
 a photographer who circled the volcano in an airplane said an aerial gunnery range at clark was covered with ash as were mountains in the zambales range normally lush green tropical peaks
 todays first eruption began at  am with a tremendous blast that sent forth a mushroom cloud
it was followed by a second explosion a few minutes later and a third smaller blast at  am the huge plume could be seen in manila  miles to the south and reporters at the scene said it blocked out the sun
the cloud drifted westward into the south china sea
 two more thundering explosions rocked mount pinatubo late today
 the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said the explosions occurred at  pm and  pm
the second explosion sent a plume of ash and steam  feet into the sky
 shortly after midnight a sixth explosion was reported
 seismologists said the volcano had plenty of builtup magma and even more severe eruptions could come later
 the crisis has not ended yet said punongbayan of the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology
we have signs that the volcano is preparing for another one
 punongbayan warned people within a mile radius of pinatubo to flee
 the smoke is very thick like a dark mushroom in the sky television reporter gus abelgas said in a broadcast from botolan near the volcanos western slopes
he said strong tremors preceded the nighttime eruptions and continued afterward
 president corazon aquino visited refugee centers near angeles briefly before returning to manila for independence day celebrations
 the americans who fled clark with a few belongings monday moved in with sailors and their families at subic bay naval base  miles to the southwest
 clark is one of the biggest us bases overseas
punongbayan said tuesday that the site was in the path of the volcanic flow from mount pinatubo during its last major eruption in  about  filipinos earlier had been evacuated from three provinces near the volcanos slopes and were housed in  makeshift evacuation centers outside the projected danger zone
 officials said more were evacuated after todays eruption
 about  people in moraza a village on the western slope of the mountain were refusing to leave relief officials said
they told rescuers that they would not leave their livestock and if the animals die we will die with them
 on april  pinatubo produced a small hydrothermal explosion caused by underground water meeting hot rocks deep inside
on june  the volcano spewed ash in a mild eruption
 that same day foot mount unzen in japan erupted with an explosion of superheated gas ashes and rocks that killed  people
 experts say there is apparently no connection between unzen and pinatubo
 there are about  active and  dormant volcanoes in the philippines
the last major eruption was the taal volcano about  miles south of manila in 
that explosion killed about  people

russia and georgia yesterday deployed blue helmet troops to stop ethnic fighting in the disputed region of south ossetia in the first peacekeeping operation since the collapse of the soviet union reuter reports from moscow
reports from the remote transcaucasian region said hundreds of heavily armed russian troops from the th paratroop battalion moved into a kmwide security zone separating rebel south ossetia from the rest of georgia
georgian national guards occupied similar positions on their side of the border and pulled out all their men from the south ossetian capital of tskhinvali
but itartass news agency said gunfire overnight near the city killed four civilians and injured two others underscoring the difficulties facing the operation
the mission was the first peacekeeping attempt anywhere in the former soviet union whose disintegration last year has prompted waves of bloodletting in ethnic flashpoints from the romanian to the afghan borders
reports from the former soviet republic of moldova said several people had been killed overnight in fresh ceasefire violations between government forces and separatists
in the transcaucasian republic of armenia radio russia said five civilians had died overnight in azerbaijani shelling the latest victims of a fouryear undeclared war which has killed  people
russia and georgia were cautiously optimistic that ossetia could be the first region of the former soviet union where armed conflict could be resolved with the help of political measures and actions
south ossetia is part of georgia but wants to unite with neighbouring north ossetia which was assigned to russia by stalin
hundreds have been killed since  in fighting between georgians and ossetians
the peacekeepers have been issued with unstyle lightblue helmet bands and matching chevrons on their sleeves
they will be joined later by a multiethnic force  russians ukrainians ossetians and other mountain peoples  under the nominal command of north ossetian leaders
the peacekeepers mission is to form a physical barrier between the two sides opening the way to future talks
the greatest threat is expected to come from hundreds of armed fighters on both sides operating independently in a dozen or so bands outside the control of either russian or georgian authorities
interfax news agency said russias vicepresident alexander rutskoi at present on a visit to moldova proposed a similar peacekeeping operation there
the earthquake that devastated iran early thursday took tens of thousands of lives because people were asleep in fragile homes built on flood plains an earthquake expert said
most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you said russ needham a geophysist with the us geological survey that monitors ground motion around the world
the quake hit at  am in iran when most of the people were in their homes needham said thursday in a telephone interview from golden colo at least  people died and thousands were injured in the quake which demolished scores of villages and buried thousands of people in the rubble of their homes iranian officials said
needham said most structures in that area are built of a ceramictype brick or adobe that collapses easily
its very similar to what we had in armenia he said of the dec   earthquake that killed about  people
a soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings
the armenian quake was measured at  on the richter scale but thursdays earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of 
the shock wave traveled through the mountainous section of coastal iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse he said
the magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area where two major plates of the earths crust meet needhams said
iran is in a very active seismic region he said and that there have been many smaller quakes
twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude  have occurred in iran during the last  years needhams said
a quake of magnitude  is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage in populated areas
as protests gathered strength last fall east germanys longtime orthodox leader erich honecker lost touch with reality according to the man who succeeded him as communist leader only to be ousted later
egon krenz the successor and former politburo member guenter schabowski on wednesday gave their versions of the bunker mentality that engulfed the hardliners toward the end
there was the notion in the former party leadership that everything outside of planned events and demonstrations staged by the communist youth group was an action organized by enemy forces krenz told an investigating commission in east berlin
the testimony was broadcast on east german television
schabowski said honecker had personally ordered police attacks against demonstrators in early october working closely with his thensecret police chief erich mielke
honecker took things into his own hands schabowski said
all decisions and orders that led to the police actions against demonstrators and to their arrrest went exclusively through honecker and mielke
like krenz schabowski denied any personal responsibility for the orders to attack the demonstrators in the capital
the attempts at suppression were engineered by honecker and mielke bypassing the other  members of the ruling politburo krenz insisted
thengeneral secretary erich honecker and the internal security chief erich mielke immediately after each session of the politburo consulted with each other on the security situation of the german democratic republic krenz said
honecker and mielke are now targeted for an indictment for high treason
the east berlin city government commission is probing possible criminal charges stemming from police brutality during the october attacks in the capital
clubswinging riot police brutally beat demonstrators on oct  and  when soviet president mikhail s gorbachev was in town to commemorate the countrys th anniversary
the uprising was a turning point that speeded honeckers downfall  days later
krenz who had responsibility for many internal security functions before honeckers ouster criticized the use of force during his testimony wednesday
the excessive action of law enforcement authorities was neither politically nor morally justifiable he told the panel speaking confidently and wearing a gray suit
krenz who was thrown out six weeks after succeeding honecker on oct  insisted he knew nothing about any orders to shoot demonstrators
numerous news media accounts have said honecker either planned or issued such orders
krenz said he accepted joint responsibility for misjudging dissident citizens and dissident groups for years
from todays viewpoint it is incomprehensible that there was no general politburo discussion about the negative developments then taking place in society said krenz an influential politburo member even before honeckers fall
krenz added that he and other thenmembers of the politburo failed to realize that the roman catholic and lutheran churches were not working against but rather for the german democratic republic
honecker had lost touch with reality and had unrealistic perspectives krenz said of his onetime patron who for years treated him like a son
honecker has been in ill health following gallbladder surgery last summer
he was recently operated on for a malignant kidney tumor
krenzs current occupation has not been publicized following his fall as party chief on dec 
federal aid was approved friday for tornadoravaged huntsville where  died and several hundred were injured or lost their homes and gov
guy hunt toured hospitals and visited with grieving families
ive been around a lot of tornadoes but ive not seen the type of damage on as broad a scale as ive seen this morning hunt said after a helicopter tour of the milelong path of destruction
state emergency management officials estimated the damage in excess of  million in the agencys letter to president bush requesting a disaster declaration said terry abbott the governors press secretary
ive never seen as much rubble from a tornado before said danny cooper the state agencys director
he listed  houses destroyed  with minor damage and three churches two schools  businesses and  public buildings either destroyed or suffering heavy damage
wind in the tornado was estimated at  mph when the twister hit wednesday afternoon
more than  people were injured with about  still under care in hospitals when hunt visited patients rooms friday
city officials said about  were left homeless
hunt asked that flags around the state be lowered to halfstaff through tuesday in memory of the victims and marilyn quayle wife of the vice president planned to visit the battered city saturday
president bush issued a disaster declaration friday morning to clear the way for tornado victims to receive federal relief
cooper said about  million may be needed in the form of individual and family grants to provide clothing and temporary housing
the federal government pays  percent of the cost and the state  percent
grant peterson associate director of the federal emergency management agency said friday he hopes that offices can be opened sunday to take applications for disaster relief
he said assistance checks may be in the mail within a week
femas reaction time was criticized after south carolina was struck by a hurricane
police spokesman ronnie fudge said several truckloads of food had arrived but the city is running out of places to store the goods
he urged that people donate money to relief agencies rather than send food
hunt visited privately friday morning with families of some of the  killed in the tornado the victims ranged in age from  to 
two of the dead john and wanda lewis were found holding each other beneath a table crushed by a collapsed ceiling at gates cleaners where lewis was manager
much of westbury mall was reduced to rubble by the tornado
to look at that building its hard to understand why more people were not killed hunt said
hunt also stopped at a school heavily damaged by the tornado
a hole in one outside wall exposed a cavedin classroom
because the tornado struck at  pm most of the classrooms were empty and only six children were injured
school personnel and painters in the building were credited with helping protect about  youngsters in extended hours and kindergarten day care programs
some children were moved into a closet for safety
there were a lot of heroes or more people would have been killed said the governor
the san francisco ers  rout of the denver broncos was the lowestrated super bowl in  years and the thirdlowest ever
the game on cbs averaged a  rating and a  share the lowest super bowl rating since  when the new york jets  victory over baltimore got a  on nbc for the worst rating ever ac nielsen co said today
the rating is a percentage of the nations televisions each point represents  homes
the share is the percentage of the televisions on at the time
despite the low rating sundays game was seen by about  million people making it the ninth mostwatched tv show ever in the united states behind eight super bowls and the final episode of mash
the higher viewership was made possible by the annual increase in the number of homes with television
given the expected blowout the numbers are completely understandable and were happy to have a  said susan kerr director of programming for cbs sports
its still a remarkable rating for prime time

embattled margaret thatcher remains leader of britains conservative party and so the countrys prime minister  but only barely
she has survived a vote of confidence taken by her party colleagues in the house of commons winning  votes against  for former defense minister michael heseltine
but under tory party rules that margin representing something less than a ringing endorsement forces thatcher to face a second round of voting on tuesday
other candidates could choose to stand against her perhaps diluting the opposition vote and letting her claim the simple majority she needs to stay as party head
but her reelection is hardly assured
polls show the tories would do better in the next national elections with someone other than thatcher leading them
but elections dont have to be called until mid thatchers public standing could conceivably increase by then
thatcher has served as pm longer than anyone in this century
she led her party to victory in three elections steered it through the war with argentina to reclaim the falklands faced down the miners union in a long strike moved  often drastically  to reverse britains economic decline and won a prominent place on the world stage
but   years in office is a long time
memory and feelings being what they are it is the mistakes and irritations of this long tenure that are more likely to be immediately recalled while its achievements are left to history to salute
thatcher is seen as having become increasingly autocratic at home and a somewhat tiresome scold within the european community
her government is deeply identified with high interest rates inflation and a flat tax on every adult in place of the property tax that is generally regarded as hugely unfair
ultimately in the cold calculus of politics the question that will most decisively sway conservative mps is whether they are more likely to win the next election with thatcher at their head or someone else
next week will bring the answer
damage caused by hurricane andrew could rise to dollars bn it was estimated yesterday as one of the costliest us storms this century threatened a further devastating landfall near the city of new orleans
government officials in louisiana mississippi and texas yesterday advised or ordered more than m people to evacuate coastal areas
the hurricane tore through southern florida early on monday morning causing billions of dollars of property damage and at least  deaths and yesterday was moving northwest across the gulf of mexico with winds of about  miles an hour
at least three people died on sunday when hurricane andrew crossed the bahamas
ms kate hale director of emergency services in floridas dade county which bore the brunt of the storm estimated that andrew had already caused dollars bn to dollars bn pounds bnpounds bn of damage
however insurance industry analysts cautioned that it was too early to assess the costs accurately
the us industrys property claims service the official compiler of disaster losses had yet to compile a preliminary tally of the florida bill
a hurricane warning was in effect yesterday along  miles of gulf coast from pascagoula mississippi to galvestone texas
several forecasting agencies suggested the likeliest landfall was in central louisiana to the west of new orleans possibly late last night or this morning
new orleans with a population of m is particularly vulnerable because the city lies below sea level has the mississippi river running through its centre and a large lake immediately to the north
much of americas oil refining industry is concentrated along coastal texas and louisiana and several refineries were yesterday partially shut down
these included british petroleums belle chasse plant in louisiana
in florida andrew caused greatest havoc in a largely suburban swathe some  miles south of miami
the town of homestead near the centre of the storm was largely flattened including a local air force base
miamis city centre escaped with relatively light damage
more than  hours after the hurricane some  households and businesses were still without power
the brunt of insurance claims from the florida storm will fall on the us industry and companies with a heavy local exposure include the state farm group and the allstate insurance unit of sears roebuck
these are also the leading propertycasualty and home insurance groups in louisiana together with american international group
a spokesman for state farm insurance said he believed the company had roughly  per cent of the florida market
the mutuallyowned company has no reinsurance
its size has made obtaining reinsurance cover difficult and its reserves at about dollars bn have made it unnecessary
according to balcombe group a ukbased claims adjustment firm other insurers with large exposure in the hurricanehit area are hartford insurance aetna and travellers
travellers said it had flown  claims adjusters in to florida late on monday and was assessing losses
about  per cent of travellers home insurance premium income came from florida last year and  per cent of its commercial insurance premiums
the last serious us hurricane hugo which struck south carolina in  cost the industry dollars bn from insured losses though estimates of the total damage caused ranged between dollars bn and dollars bn
typhoon yunya packing  mph winds slammed into the eastern coast of luzon island which includes mount pinatubo early in the day
but it quickly weakened to a tropical storm with  mph winds by the time it was centered about  miles east of the volcano
 still heavy rains churned up by the typhoon drenched manila and the provinces near the volcano raising fears of mudflows that could bury whole towns up to  miles away
 meanwhile president corazon aquino dismissed a british newspaper report that americans had warned her of possible radioactive contamination if the volcano damages nuclear storage sites at clark air base abandoned monday by nearly  americans
 the us military began flying home hundreds of the  americans who crowded onto subic bay naval base as a bizarre tropical blizzard of thick volcanic ash caused power failures across the base friday during a third day of increasingly violent eruptions of mount pinatubo
 showers of mud drops it looks like its snowing outside said military spokeswoman capt
kim urie
headlights and street lamps were turned on at midafternoon as a dark black cloud passed over the giant navy base and dropped a gritty rain of mud drops she said
 at least four people have died  have been hurt and four have been listed as missing since pinatubo began erupting sunday after lying dormant for six centuries officials said
about  people including americans have been evacuated
 police said  people had been arrested for looting at clark
 five explosions shook the mountain early today showering ash over a wide area and providing a spectacular predawn display of natures fireworks against a backdrop of lightning and rain
 friday eight thunderous explosions shot a cloud of ash and steam nearly  miles high
 fridays eruptions hurled ash over clark  miles east of the volcano and subic  miles southwest where the clark personnel had been temporarily housed
gray ash also fell in manila  miles south
 at subic base spokesman robert coble said generators had to be shut down from time to time to clean out volcanic ash plunging the base into darkness
 river temperatures rising temperatures in local rivers were rising because of the volcanic debris officials said
 after sunset the volcano spewed two streams of orange glowing material from its crater in what scientists thought was the first appearance of lava during the weeklong eruptions
 raymundo punongbayan director of the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said fridays blasts were part of a single eruption the largest since mount pinatubo awoke sunday from its year slumber
 a british newspaper the guardian reported thursday that the americans declared a nuclear alert at clark late wednesday and informed governments in manila and hong kong that a nuclear accident in the region was possible
but aquino told reporters the story was baseless and purely fabricated
 the united states refuses to confirm or deny that it stores nuclear weapons in the philippines
 foreign secretary raul manglapus also said the eruption should have no effect on talks on the future of clark and subic where leases expire sept 
the talks are deadlocked over compensation and the duration of a new agreement
 punongbayan said mount pinatubo could remain active for years if it follows the pattern of similar philippine volcanoes
that would leave clark unusable
an explosion today flattened a military barracks and tore through nearby homes killing  people and injuring  police said
the ira claimed responsibility for the blast
more than  rescue workers frantically dug through the rubble of a threestory building that collapsed at the royal marines school of music near deal
stunned neighbors gathered outside homes that were damaged or destroyed
chief police inspector alan butterfield of kent who who provided the casualty figures and coordinated the rescue effort first reported that one person was missing but later said everyone was accounted for
he said many of the injured were seriously hurt
there was a terrific crash which reminded me of the blitz
after that the ceiling started to fall down around me said pensioner joan betteridge
defense secretary tom king inspecting the wreckage said it is not yet absolutely confirmed that it is a bomb but all the evidence is quite clearly that this is an ira atrocity
british military installations are a frequent bombing target of the irish republican army in its campaign to rid northern ireland of british rule but todays explosion in the coastal town  miles southeast of london was the worst ira attack on the british mainland in more than seven years
the explosion occurred at at  am in a lounge in the barracks
one of the bands had just stopped playing on the parade ground said a ministry spokesman speaking anonymously in keeping with british custom
dozens of homes near the school were damaged including four that were destroyed
witnesses reported hearing the explosion two miles away
the defense ministry would not say how many servicemen and civilians were included in the casualty figures
however king told reporters the attack was directed against unarmed bandsmen
firefighters used heavy lifting equipment and thermal cameras to search through the debris said kent fire brigade spokesman kevin simmons
ten doctors were giving emergency treatment at the scene and  ambulances were taking the injured to two hospitals the ambulance service said
a statement telephoned to ireland international a dublin news agency said we have visited the royal marines in kent in response to prime minister margaret thatchers visit to northern ireland nine days ago
the ira said mrs thatcher went to the british province with a message of war but we still want peace and we want the british government to leave our country
it was signed p oneill a nom de guerre the ira usually uses to claim responsibility for actions outside northern ireland
irish prime minister charles haughey issued a statement in dublin condemning the attack calling it an outrage
the last ira bomb attempt on the british mainland was in february when about  soldiers were evacuated from their barracks in shropshire western england just before a bomb exploded
one soldier was killed and nine wounded in an ira bomb attack on an army barracks in north london in august 
in july  eight soldiers died in ira bombings near the household cavalry barracks in central london and at a bandstand in the capitals regents park where an army band was playing
three people died later and a total of  were injured in the bombings
the music school is the training center for young recruits who want to play in the seven royal marines bands
up to  young men most between  and  are based at the school where they receive military and musical training
the roof of janet minnocks house was torn off by the force of the blast and all the back windows were shattered
the house has been blown to bits she said
we are all shaken up
mrs minnocks nextdoor neighbor heather hackett said she was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks at the time of the explosion
she was holding her monthold son luke in her arms with her other boys ben  and joshua  at her side
i looked up from the sink and i just saw the whole building explode she said
i told the boys to run and as joshua turned a slither of glass embedded itself in his back
the whole window was blown across the kitchen
i just screamed and ran out of the room
the bang was so loud i thought the whole house was coming in
sean minnock said i was asleep but woke up with a hell of a jolt
as workers tried to patch holes in his roof he said the bedroom ceiling fell in on me
i woke to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor
i wondered what it was
as soon as i got up i looked out of what was left of the window and knew it was the barracks
british media entrepreneur robert maxwell said monday that he is involved in negotiations to buy a us newspaper valued in the hundreds of millions of dollars
maxwell declined to identify the newspaper but his comments prompted industry speculation that it might be gannetts usa today tribune cos new york daily news or the chicago suntimes
officials of each of those newspapers denied that they were negotiating with maxwell
maxwells comments were made to reporters at the annual meeting in new york of maxwells berlitz international and were confirmed later by a spokesman for maxwell communications the investors londonbased holding company
the spokesman declined to elaborate on the remarks and said maxwell had left the united states
the daily news has one of the united states largest circulations but in recent years it has struggled to restore profitability and maintain circulation in a market with three other dailies
the paper is conducting difficult labor contract negotiations with its unions
some analysts said it might make sense for maxwell to try to purchase usa today since it would mesh well with his efforts to print and distribute his monthold paneuropean englishlanguage paper the european in this country
maxwell has already been in negotiations with usa today officials about printing the paper for us distribution
other industry officials conjectured that maxwell might be talking to the chicago suntimes which has seen daily circulation slide more than  papers to about  since 
maxwell who publishes britains daily mirror recently bought three us supermarket tabloids the globe national examiner and the sun for an estimated  million
a therapist defended her interviews of alleged victims in the mcmartin preschool molestation trial despite criticism by several jurors who said leading questions undermined the prosecutions case
the jury on thursday acquitted raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey of  child molestation counts and deadlocked on  other counts
therapist kee mcfarlane later defended her work with hundreds of mcmartin students and suggested that the goals of therapy are at odds with the legal standards required for a successful criminal prosecution
what is in the interest of children is not always in the interest of the legal system she said
evidence introduced by prosecutors in what became the longest and most expensive criminal trial in us history included videotaped interviews of the alleged victims
many of the interviews were conducted at an early stage of the sexual abuse investigation by macfarlane a social worker and director of the child sexual abuse center at childrens institute international
macfarlane said thursday she still believes children from the school had been molested and that they had not fabricated their accounts of abuse
this agency would never have gone all the way through what we have if we did not believe these children she said
at least seven jurors who attended a news conference agreed the evidence showed children had been molested
but the jurors were sharply critical of the interviewers technique at the institute
the children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them said juror john breese
all the questions were leading
if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had not seen them i could have believed the children a little more juror brenda williams said
but macfarlane said that the interviewing techniques were sound noting that small children must be interviewed differently than adults
i didnt put words into their mouths she said
i tried to enable them to get over their fears
macfarlane acknowledged that some procedures could have been done differently including conducting more interviews over a longer period of time
she called the outcome of the case a tragic consequence of an attempt to prevent trauma to these children
but the institutes executive director mary m emmons said some good may come out of the case
it has greatly increased the awareness about the issue of child sexual abuse and about the problems of prosecuting these cases she said
iraq struck back against the west today rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in kuwait as the un security council overwhelming approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against iraq to punish it for invading the emirate
the iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of westerners based in kuwait or caught by the invasion
more than  million foreigners live and work in kuwait
several hundred britons americans and west germans were grabbed in the hotels and some were taken to iraq the west german and british foreign ministries said
britain said baghdad had given no reason for detaining  people most of them passengers from a british airways flight stranded at kuwait airport by the invasion
the un sanctions which included a ban on oil purchases came on a vote of  to  on the member council

iraqi troops rolled into its new jerseysized neighbor thursday conquering the capital and moving south toward the saudi arabian border
persian gulf oil sources said today that they had seen saudi troops moving north toward the kuwaiti frontier near the oil port of khafji but the saudis denied that they had sent reinforcements to the border
iraqi authorities today told turkeys staterun pipeline company that one of the twin pipelines that carry baghdads oil through turkey will be closed for reasons of marketing officials said
world oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as more countries joined the attempt to strangle baghdads economy and force it to withdraw its invasion troops
iraqs oil revenues totaled more than  billion last year
it has been pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the  war with iran and settle foreign debts of up to  billion
one of the reasons iraq gave for invading kuwait was kuwaiti reluctance to slow its flow of oil and push oil prices higher but it was iraqi oil that had slowed today
there are very few tankers loading iraqi oil at yumurtalik a senior turkish government official said referring to the export jetties on the turkish side of the mediterranean sea
in baghdad president saddam hussein ordered drills for millions of people in case mass evacuations were needed
he warned his nations  million people to be on alert for possible us or israeli attacks
the united states has warned iraq against any attack on saudi arabia and president bush has said all options are open for the united states
hundreds of kuwaitis took to the desert to flee into saudi arabia their children and a few belongings crammed into fourwheeldrive vehicles

the quake was centered on the san andreas segment described in the article but tom heaton the scientist in charge of the us geological survey office in pasadena said it wasnt clear yet whether it broke all or part of the mile segment
the epicenter of the quake was about  miles northeast of santa cruz and  miles south of san francisco
the  study by columbia university geology professor christopher scholz was among several that produced conflicting estimates on the likelihood and size of the quake that finally happened tuesday
these studies gave various interpretations of how much stress inside the earth was released by the great san francisco earthquake of  which had a magnitude of about  and killed at least  people
the bigger a quake the more stress it relieves and thus the longer it takes for the same size quake to happen again
scholz pointed to evidence that the  quake didnt relieve as much stress in the santa cruz mountains as other scientists believed
that suggested a bigger quake might happen in the san francisco bay area sooner than some believed
others disagreed
faced with conflicting estimates the geological survey issued a july  report that it said represented a consensus on the debate
the report said the mile segment had a  percent likelihood of producing a magnitude quake within  years
it said the southernmost  miles of that segment had a  percent chance of generating a magnitude quake within  years
tuesdays jolt was centered within those southernmost  miles of the fault segment
clearly scientists had identified this segment as a particularly hazardous one heaton said
there was some debate about the length of the rupture and the size of the earthquake
the last great southern california quake in  killed very few people in a region that was then sparsely populated
thus most assumed that los angeles not the bay area would fall victim to the next seismic catastrophe the  usgs report cast doubt on this assumption
federal emergency officials have estimated that the next big one  a quake like the  san francisco quake  could kill  to  people in southern california and  to  people in the bay area
as bad as tuesdays quake was it was not a  earthquake geological survey director dalas peck said
the question is not whether a big earthquake is coming
the question is when peck said
president bush filling a key overseas post has decided to nominate a former cia officer as ambassador to china sources said wednesday
the choice is james r lilley a career intelligence officer who served as cia station chief in china when bush headed the us liaison office there in 
word of the expected nomination came as bushs choice to be assistant secretary of state for latin america democratic political consultant bernard aronson ran into objections from several republican members of the senate foreign relations committee congressional aides said
the two senior republicans on the panel sens
jesse helms rnc and richard g lugar rind
 both expressed concern about aronsons appointment to secretary of state james a baker iii the aides said
may face tough questioning they said that it appears unlikely the senators would attempt to block aronsons nomination but said that the former jimmy carter aide will face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings
lilley  was born in china the son of an american oilman working there
he has also served on the national security council staff as head of the unofficial us office in taiwan and as a deputy assistant secretary of state for east asia
he will replace winston lord who has headed the american embassy in beijing since 
for the last three years lilley served as us ambassador to south korea
in that job he was the principal american contact with south korean leaders during the turbulent period when former president chun doo hwan resigned and the current president roh tae woo won a bitterly contested election
returns to washington lilley left seoul last month and returned to washington hoping to be appointed as assistant secretary of state in charge of us policy in east asia and the pacific sources said
however he failed to get that job in part because newly appointed deputy secretary of state lawrence s eagleburger opposed him the sources said
eagleburger was said to have been promoting two other candidates  lord and us
ambassador to the philippines nicholas platt  for the asian post
eagleburger and lord served together as aides to former secretary of state henry a kissinger
within hours of the schoolyard shootings that left five children and the gunman dead and  wounded tuesday dozens of translators rushed to assist the many southeast asian parents who arrived at the hospital desperate for word of their youngsters
i would imagine it is absolute panic
they are not sure what happened not sure whats going on around them said laura dixon of the charterhouse center refugee program in stockton describing the scene translators found when they arrived at san joaquin county general hospital
many of the parents speak no english and were unable to ask whether their children were among those killed or wounded when a heavily armed gunman in combat fatigues invaded cleveland elementary school and opened fire before taking his own life
they do have people on staff at the hospital but they are so overloaded they need every extra person they can secure said dixon whose organization began calling throughout stockton for volunteers speaking southeast asian languages
about a dozen translators were sent to the county hospital after officials there called for help
in recent years thousands of southeast asians have settled in stockton drawn in part by the farming and fishing that flourish in the area
school officials said  percent of the children were southeast asian refugees  either from cambodia laos or thailand
all five of the children killed were of this background authorities said
a stockton woman who runs an afterschool program teaching english to cambodian refugees dispatched  translators including volunteers from all over the city to the school and the hospital dixon said
the san joaquin county mental health department told dixon a grief center might be established at charterhouse to help survivors whose recovery will be complicated by the language barrier
charterhouse is funded by the episcopal church and private donations
supercomputers satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast
but hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science
forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugos path into charleston sc all the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models said thomas pyke head of national oceanic and atmospheric administrations satellite service
pinpointing the exact point of hugos landfall was difficult but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation
overall i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner said research meteorologist colin mcadie
the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm which was upgraded to a category  hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston
it is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we dont have very reliable computer models for that mcadie said
we really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength
the hurricane specialists were surprised by the lastminute increase in wind speed which was reported to them by air force reconnaissance
hurricane specialist gil clark who has tracked hurricanes for  years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships
we had no radar or satellites then so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate clark said
in the late s the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture
information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the largescale models that television viewers see every night
using the information from the satellite supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland md send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane
to determine the track of the storm the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions satellite data the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane
then they make an educated guess about the landfall
meteorology professor kerry a emmanuel of the massachussetts institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system
congress and the american people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isnt true emmanuel said
satellites can give a pretty picture he said but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricanes path
most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane and they do a very good job emmanuel said
forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so longrange forecasting should become more precise
we have to remember that those models used are only guidance products pyke said and that its ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storms path
east germanys deposed communist leader erich honecker is too sick to be held in jail but is fit enough to be tried the official news agency adn reported monday
adn quoting a health ministry statement said honecker was still recovering from surgery for kidney cancer in january and was not well enough to be incarcerated
but a medical exam by a team of doctors found him in condition to be questioned and to stand trial adn said
honecker  ruled east germany for  years until he was ousted in october as a wave of prodemocracy demonstrations swept the country leading to the peaceful overthrow of the communist government and the opening of the berlin wall
the medical panel concluded that seven other former communist officials who had been among honeckers closest aides were all fit to prosecute and to be placed in custody adn said
it said former secret police chief erich mielke former economics czar guenter mittag and former labor chief harry tisch were under arrest while the other four remained free
all three had been members of the ruling politburo under honecker
mielke was arrested on thursday
honecker and the seven are charged with corruption and abuse of office
they had been arrested soon after honeckers fall but were later released because of advanced age and poor health
honecker has been staying at a soviet military hospital outside east berlin
adn quoted federal prosecutor guenter seidel as saying he intended to continue his investigation against the former east german leaders although their poor health often disrupted the proceedings
john major the yearold chancellor of the exchequer who rose out of one of londons toughest neighborhoods and the unemployment line was selected tuesday as britains next prime minister
major whose father was once a circus trapeze artist was elected leader of the conservative party to replace margaret thatcher whose sudden resignation under pressure last week surprised the nation
thatcher formally presents her resignation today to queen elizabeth ii who will then ask major to form a new government
the conservatives choice of major a thatcher protege came after a battle pitting him against two other contenders for the party leadership former defense secretary michael heseltine and foreign secretary douglas hurd
the threeway race took shape last week when thatcher stunned by heseltines strong showing in the firstround voting for party leader resigned
in the secret secondround balloting among the  tory members of the house of commons on tuesday major got  votes  two shy of the total he needed for an outright victory
but as party members began preparing themselves for a thursday runoff between major and heseltine the runnerup both heseltine with  votes and hurd with  threw their support to major
thatcher said she was thrilled by majors victory adding that he was her personal favorite among the three contenders
major becomes britains th prime minister and the youngest in this century
his election ensures the unity of the fractured conservative party which now has become the favorite to defeat the opposition labor party in the next general election
before thatchers resignation the polls had been favoring labor
appearing outside his official residence at no
 downing st next to the prime ministers major declared tuesday evening we are going to unite totally and absolutely and we are going to win the next election
it is a very exciting thing to become leader of the conservative party and particularly exciting i think to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the conservative party has ever had major said
he complimented his rivals for a campaign based on substance not personality
when the results of tuesdays vote were announced about  pm both heseltine and hurd said that they would vote for major in the scheduled third runoff ballot on thursday and advised their supporters to do the same
party leaders however waived the third ballot  which was expected to be unanimous  and major was declared party leader
after his appointment by the queen today he is expected to name his cabinet in a few days
president bush en route to washington after a visit to mexico telephoned major from aboard air force one to congratulate him
the president said he looked forward to working with major and to maintaining the special relationship with britain said white house press secretary marlin fitzwater
in washington the state and defense departments also welcomed the news
were very glad that its all settled and that it was able to be settled so quickly a state department official said
we know john major and expect to work well with him
we dont expect any change in usuk
relations
after majors election thatcher declared that she wanted everyone to rally behind him
the prime minister had picked major from among backbenchers  those who are not party leaders  as someone to watch several years ago and regarded him aides said as a man of the people
with her support he rose swiftly through the department of social security and then the treasury
thatcher will remain a member of the house of commons representing the finchley section of london
she and her husband denis will move out of  downing st today to their house in the south london community of dulwich
thatcher may accept a peerage in the house of lords as a hereditary countess friends said since earldoms the male equivalent are the traditional award to former prime ministers
that tradition was not followed by recent labor prime ministers
major is a high school dropout who made his name in banking before winning a seat in the house of commons in 
he has few enemies and is regarded as a leader who can unify the party and associates said tuesday night lead the tories to victory in the next election which must be held within  months at a time of the partys choosing
he is not expected to introduce any major new policies but will take a more sympathetic view toward britains role in the european community and has promised to review the controversial community charge the socalled poll tax introduced by thatcher
labor party leader neil kinnock who likely will face major in the next national election immediately labeled him more of the same in the thatcher mold
the labor party had expected to defeat an unpopular thatcher in the next election
jack cunningham labors campaign coordinator argued that majors victory was that of the thatcher candidate
cunningham pointed out that  members of majors own party a majority in the house of commons voted against him tuesday
that in a sense was true
with  votes in the threeway race major did not gain as many as the  votes thatcher won nov  when heseltine was her sole opponent
that vote  while she was in paris attending the summit meeting of the conference on security and cooperation in europe  forced her into a runoff with heseltine and ultimately cost her the party leadership
but in that vote under the partys complicated rules she needed a majority plus  and she fell four votes short
in tuesdays ballot only a simple majority was needed to win outright
the prime ministers downfall came after she had run into a stretch of unpopularity  partly through her authoritarian manner partly because of inflation and high interest rates and partly because of her unpopular new poll tax
she also appeared to take an antieuropean attitude toward her  partners in the european community which caused her longserving cabinet colleague and deputy prime minister geoffrey howe to resign and deliver a witheringly critical resignation speech
that speech led heseltine who had walked out of the cabinet in  in a dispute over how to aid of a defense contractor to challenge thatcher for the leadership in that first ballot last tuesday
the prime ministers failure to gain the necessary majority forced her to reassess her position
her closest advisers reported that her support in the house of commons was eroding friends said so she decided to resign rather than risk the humiliation of a defeat at the hands of one of her own colleagues
at that point on thursday morning both major and hurd loyal members of her cabinet entered the race against heseltine
many tories in parliament were angry at heseltine for his role in bringing down thatcher who had won three national elections during her  years as conservative party leader
her  year tenure as prime minister was the longest in this century
her confrontational style of leadership won her many admirers at home and abroad  and many enemies here and in the european community
during the past few days major picked up strength among his colleagues as opinion polls showed him to be the next most popular tory after heseltine nationwide
on monday thatcher let it be known that she personally preferred major to succeed her
some commentators feared that thatchers revelation of her choice might harm major  with her comment tuesday morning that she would make a good backseat driver
labor members called major mrs thatchers poodle
but major was the clearcut victor in the balloting held from  am to  pm tuesday in a house of commons committee room
after the results were announced heseltine declared that the election had been fought without rancor and bitterness
to lay the basis for unity he said he would ask his supporters to vote for major in the expected third ballot on thursday as he himself would do
soon afterward hurd did the same
a third ballot seemed certain until cranley onslow who heads the conservative party organization called the  committee which supervised the party election announced that another ballot would not be necessary and declared major the party leader
it was not immediately clear whether hurd and heseltine would join majors cabinet though majors aides indicated they would be offered roles in the government
conservative party members of all hues were elated by the result and by the fact that the short campaign was conducted in the most gentlemanly fashion with no blood on the floor
the labor party almost overnight went from being the strong favorite in the next election to second place behind a tory party led by major
recent opinion polls had suggested that any new leader would greatly enhance tory popularity
labors cunningham declared that the conservatives lead was a temporary blip and promised to fight an election as soon as he major names a date
tory election results despite being two votes short of a majority john major was elected leader of the ruling conservative party after his challengers conceded defeat
he will bwcome prime minister when formally confirmed by the queen
john major  michael heseltine  douglas hurd   votes needed to win the conservative party holds  seats in the seat parliament
already theyre saying its the biggest happening in astronomy since galileo put his eye to a telescope
so step right up folks and discover the wonders of the universe
see how big it is
learn its age
look at light created  billion years ago and arriving at your eye only this instant
ride along to the beginning of everything almost to the big bang of  or  thousand million years ago
see stars born and see them die
watch galaxies form
follow the flow of gas into the milky ways halo
peer deep into the universe past so many stars in our own galaxy that it would take a person more than a lifetime to count to a hundred billion other galaxies each with about  billion stars
for scientists and then the rest of us all that becomes possible now that the space shuttle discovery has carried the hubble space telescope into the sky to see what no one has seen before
the telescope a silvery tube as long as a tanker truck has an unmatched ability to detect and capture the faintest light
light speeding along at  miles a second is the messenger of creation
tracking the trail of light from today to the first moments contains all the information we will ever have about the creation of the universe
the hubble promises to give science an open window perhaps to the first echoes of creation
this is a worldclass event even if astronomy is not your thing
superlatives
in the history of optical astronomy there have been two great leaps in the resolution of the universe galileos telescope in the autumn of  and the hubble space telescope in april 
 eric j chaisson a senior scientist at the space telescope science institute in baltimore
one more
no one ever made anything that good james westphal california institute of technology
another
dr lennard fisk nasas chief scientist predicts that the hubble telescope will literally be the dawn of a new era in astronomy
eras rarely can be proclaimed in advance
but the hst named after edwin powell hubble holds that kind of promise
hubble was an astronomer in the first half of the century who concluded not only that distant galaxies are moving away from earth but that the farther away they are the faster they move
the theory of an expanding universe supported the belief that the universe originated in a cosmic explosion and that all matter is still rushing from the site of that socalled big bang
astronomers think the big bang occurred  billion to  billion years ago and sent the entire universe flying out at incredible speed and heat
eventually matter cooled and condensed into galaxies stars and planets
there are bigger telescopes than the hubble but they are all on earth and all subject to a major limitation  the atmosphere  which is fine for breathing but lousy for seeing through
the problem of skywatching through layers of air has been likened to birdwatching from the bottom of a swimming pool
the voyager spacecraft which sent back astonishing views of earths sister planets had to travel  years to get close enough for pictures as they whizzed past
with the hubble says scientist edward weiler such pictures are possible any time we want
the telescope is  by  feet and consists of a inch primary mirror that gathers incoming light
on a clear dark night you can see a flashlight from two miles away says weiler chief nasa scientist on the hubble project
with a power telescope you can see it on the moon  miles away
with the hst you could see a firefly in australia from washington
actresses lauren bacall betty comden and phyllis newman are among performers in the birthday bash being thrown in august for conductor leonard bernstein at the music center where he got his start
the tanglewood music center also is celebrating the th anniversary of its music shed this summer with a special concert by the resident boston symphony orchestra featuring the same music beethovens ninth symphony that inaugurated the building in 
the bernstein weekend alone with tickets as high as  each may bring in more than  million for the festivals endowment fund according to caroline smedvig of the symphony
because tanglewood is so special for him and conversely hes so special to us the combination will produce what we hope will be a unique event she said
the leonard bernstein gala birthday performance is a fourday affair beginning on the composers th birthday aug  to raise money for the music center
beverly sills who announced last month that she will step down as general director of the new york city opera will be the host of the event
bacall and soprano barbara hendricks will perform a movement from bernsteins symphony no
 kaddish
violin soloist midori will play two movements from his serenade
dame gwyneth jones and frederica von stade will be among those performing highlights from fidelio and other works to honor bernsteins landmark opera recordings
the concert will also celebrate bernsteins accomplishments in popular music with excerpts from such works as west side story and on the town
the orchestra opened the nineweek season with the special july  concert marking the first halfcentury of the music shed
the season of classical music will be expanded with performances by such popular rock jazz and folk artists as the beach boys george benson and leo kottke
but the highlight of the new season is the celebration of bernsteins birthday
the bso is even billing the birthday party as one of the music worlds great occasions and is negotiating the television rights in the united states and europe
among the conductors friends who have been invited to the bash are pop star michael jackson and british princess diana although tanglewood officials say the have not yet received an answer from the celebrities
bernstein was a member of the original tanglewood music center class of  where he became a protege of tanglewood founder serge koussevitzky
when koussevitzky retired in  he tried to have the young bernstein named as his successor but the bsos trustees chose charles munch because they considered bernstein too young and tainted by popular music
he later wrote the score for the musical west side story and returned every summer to conduct and teach
conductors seiji ozawa john williams john mauceri and michael tillson thomas will share the poduim featuring some of his works on the night of his birth
the following night ozawa and special guests will appear in a music shed concert for a performance intended to show bernsteins influence on other musicians
aug  will be given over to a performance of bernsteins mass by a member troupe from the indiana university school of music
the fourday celebration concludes with bernstein conducting the annual serge and ola koussevitzky memorial concert including a performance of tchaikovskys symphony no
 on aug 
all proceeds go to the music centers endowment fund and to a fund bernstein established for aspiring young conductors
ticket prices start at  for a space on the lawn and go up to  for front row seats for benefactors
other highlights of the new season include several major debuts including that of soviet painist vladimir feltsman who arrived in the united states last august after an an eightyear battle to emigrate a return visit by the israel philharmonic and a recital by irish flutist james galway
this summer is the second in a fouryear jubilee of the festivals th anniversary
events climax in  with observances marking the th year of the music center the festivals school
her critics see her as more than the supportive spouse wholl accompany her husband clarence through his senate confirmation hearings which began tuesday and are likely to run through next week
they see a woman with strong opinions on issues that are bound to come before the court
 some womensrights activists are upset by her lobbying against such issues as comparableworth legislation
some religious rights groups are troubled by her anticult activities in light of her former involvement with lifespring a motivational group
 skin color an issue even the color of her skin is being used to determine the content of clarence thomass character
the fact that she is white has drawn criticism from some blacks who see the marriage as evidence that clarence thomas has rejected his roots
 in their respective careers the thomases have embraced the view that women and minorities are hindered rather than helped by affirmative action and government programs
true equality is achieved by holding everyone to the same standard they believe
 i dont think its fair to say shes antiwomens rights said ricky silberman vice chairwoman of the eeoc and a friend of the thomases
she said virginia thomas opposed legislation on comparable worth because it would have involved the government in determining wages which is not good for the economy not good for workers not good for women
 conservative viewpoint virginia thomas has represented the conservative viewpoint in her jobs as a staffer for a republican congressman spokeswoman at the us chamber of congress and deputy assistant secretary at the department of labor
 clarence thomas advocates a colorblind society and his marriage may be an example of that philosophy
but others see a different symbolism
 his marrying a white woman is a sign of his rejection of the black community said russell adams chairman of howard universitys department of afroamerican studies
great justices have had community roots that served as a basis for understanding the constitution
clarences lack of a sense of community makes his nomination troubling
 religious leaders wonder some religious leaders are troubled as well
dean kelley the national council of churches counselor on religious liberty wrote a critique of clarence thomas that was used as grounds for his organizations opposition to the supreme court nominee
the author did not mention virginia thomas in his text but has said he was concerned about her involvement in the cult awareness network can a chicagobased organization that says it educates the public about destructive cults
that involvement he said might affect her husbands handling of religiousliberty cases if he shares her views on the subject
 during the early s virginia thomas enrolled in lifespring a selfhelp course that challenges students to take responsibility for their lives
a small percentage of the programs  graduates have been deeply disturbed by lifesprings methods which involve intense emotional selfexamination
 a clean break virginia thomas was troubled by some of lifesprings activities and eventually broke with the organization
since  she has been a public advocate against cult activities
 when she served as a laborrelations attorney at the us chamber of commerce from  to  she represented the interests of the business community at congressional hearings on such issues as comparable worth affirmative action and federal childcare legislation
here is a brief chronology in the dispute between iraq and kuwait over oil production and their common border
july   iraqi president saddam hussein accuses kuwait and the united arab emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices down and that the move cost iraq  billion in lost oil revenue
he further charges that arab states in the persian gulf are conspiring with the united states and israel to weaken iraqs economy and undermine its military buildup
july   iraq accuses kuwait of stealing  billion worth of oil from wells along the disputed border with iraq and of seeking to wreck iraqs economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down prices
july   kuwaiti officials suggest iraqs sudden outburst of belligerence is aimed at getting its creditors  including kuwait  to write off billions of dollars in debts from the  iraniraq war
july   the us defense department announces that us navy warships and aircraft are holding a shortnotice exercise in the persian gulf with the united arab emirates about  miles southeast of the kuwaitiraqi border
kuwait reinstates a state of alert it declared july  and canceled after three days of tension between the two oilproducing countries
july   the iraqi government in baghdad says that it will not be intimidated by us pressure in its oil dispute with neighboring kuwait and saddams summons the us ambassador for talks
president hosni mubarak of egypt says iraq and kuwait plan to meet in saudi arabia in an effort to resolve their dispute
july   opec ministers in geneva agree to halt overproduction in hopes of pushing up the price of crude oil
kuwait and the united arab emirates pledge to abide by the agreement
analysts say saddam clearly influenced the outcome of the meetings
july   kuwaiti and iraqi delegations meet in jiddah saudi arabia to negotiate the oil and border dispute
diplomats say iraq has massed  troops on kuwaits border more than triple the number originally estimated
that number dwarfs the kuwaiti army which has a total of about  troops
aug   iraq pulls out of talks on the weekold border oil and money dispute with kuwait shortly before it sends its forces to invade the oilrich sheikdom
aug   iraqs powerful army overruns kuwait before dawn with tankled troops quickly seized the rulers palace and other government buildings
lucille ball whose death wednesday morning at the age of  will be the most widely and deeply felt showbusiness loss in recent memory was the movies greatest gift to television
it turned out to be one of sam goldwyns finest and most prophetic hours when he signed her as one of his goldwyn girls to appear in roman scandals with eddie cantor in 
she had had bit parts in two earlier films but roman scandals was the one that gave her a firmer foothold on the slippery slopes of a hollywood career
the movies prepared her for television
she perfected her matchless craft as a comedienne in dozens of films including three of fred astaires and one of the marx brothers room service
a lot of the other films caused few ripples on the wide surface of film history
but in those years lucy was refining her enduring endearing public image as a perky saucy woman who was likelier at least in the early days to end up with the heros funny pal than with the hero himself
yet as often happened with supporting performers her verve an engagingly sharp tongue and a rather salty view of the world made her more interesting than the squarecut principals and led to leading roles
to look at the i love lucy reruns today as everybody does again and again is to realize how superbly professional they are
today many sitcoms still use the threecamera technique shooting in front of live audiences that desi arnaz pioneered
the idea now seems as inevitable as the wheel or presliced muffins and yet you wonder if it would have worked nearly as well or caught on at all without lucys sheer expertise as a physical as well as a verbal comedienne
she made it all  even the wildest craziest capers  look as if it were happening now  spontaneous unrehearsed accidental the inevitable consequences of the screen lucys scatterbrained and lovable personality
her foils  desi himself vivian vance and william frawley  were superb farceurs themselves but lucy was the dynamo that made it all work
the craft was invisible the skills so perfected they concealed themselves totally
it was a brilliant illusion generating a charm that hid the hard work and the artful writing and editing as well as the performing
the result was probably the finest and certainly the most durable single series in televisions history thus far
the appeal of the lucy shows was also the most universal that american television has yet provided
they were wholly prototypically american and that is central to their popularity abroad
yet they have been embraced as the kind of middleclass goingson that might possibly arise almost anywhere there is a middle class
lucy was allamerican but equally a citizen of the world
her successful career in films in which she ultimately earned star billing if not superstar status gave her an invaluable identification when i love lucy began
the irony is that created by the movies she was to achieve fame and fortune in television on a scale that had eluded her in the movies
indeed when lucy began to commandeer our hearts on i love lucy in  the movies were already in considerable trouble their audiences staying home in large numbers to watch the likes of lucy in their living rooms
as always her timing was impeccable
lucille ball was not lucy of course
she had come a hard road from jamestown ny in a line of work in which you did not survive by being scatterbrained
she was smart hardworking and a perfectionist who knew that whatever else it was comedy was not accidental
then again the cameras television or film have xray properties and the millions who saw and loved her were not wrong to think they perceived a generous and loving woman as well as a glorious clown who knew the world was better off laughing
iraqi president saddam hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring kuwait
the invasion unprecedented in modern arab history reflected the brutality saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 
the sentence for criticizing saddam is death and the president considered kuwaits oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to iraq
iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living
oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them he said last month after prices tumbled below  per barrel
he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing iraq  billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the organization of petroleum exporting countries
he also accused kuwait of stealing  billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border and demanded that kuwait write off an estimated  billion it loaned iraq during the persian gulf war
saddam was reported to be incensed that kuwait was demanding repayment for the wartime loans
saddam said he fought the war to protect the arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in persian mainly shiite moslem iran
never mind that iraq started the war in  by invading iran after a series of border skirmishes along the shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the gulf
despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory the long conflict stalled iraqs development dragging on for eight years
it has still not formally ended
the war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the iraqi people directly after the war
the  budget slashed funds for imports and iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity
private investment has failed to take hold
iraq ended the war an estimated  billion in debt
its main gulf port of basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged
tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners of war languish in iranian prisons and an estimated  iraqis were killed or wounded
despite its puny size kuwaits oil reserves almost match iraqs  billion barrels
by controlling kuwait saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the persian gulf war and fulfill iraqs longstanding wish for more gulf coastline
iraqs  troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make kuwait capitulate to iraqs demands
but kuwaits pledge two weeks ago to obey new opec quotas and saddams promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak that he would not invade lulled the arab world into the sense the crisis was over
homage to the cause of arab unity has been paramount in middle east politics since postwar independence from colonial powers
although a civil war in yemen in the s brought egyptian and saudi arabian intervention on opposing sides no arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow arab league member
despite iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate kuwait it has long coveted the tiny emirate
the iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in  and threatened to attack then but backed down when britain landed troops in kuwait
the invasion shook kuwaits neighbors along the gulf
it proved the decadeold gulf cooperation council that groups saudi arabia bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and kuwait was toothless
the gcc did not issue a statement much less implement its mutual defense treaty
while iraq was unlikely to invade saudi arabia it could use the precedent of kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues
bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to kuwait when it balked at iraqi demands
also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable
in a series of bellicose statements in recent months saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside iraq
in march he threatened to burn half of israel with iraqs chemical weapons  banned under international law  if iraq was attacked
it was a popular stance among arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a palestinian nation in the arabisraeli conflict
then britain arrested several people on charges they were smuggling nuclear triggers into baghdad
weeks later police in europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells into israel
saddam cried foul claiming the west was trying to wreck the scientific progress of the arabs
saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late egyptian president gamal abdel nassar as the leader of the arab world
his relentless personality cult has dubbed him the knight of the arabs
for kuwait on thursday he was a dark knight
asked the reason for the invasion kuwaits ambassador to washington sheik saud nasir alsabah said at a news conference ambition
hegemony
control of the whole area
there is not any reason for it
saudi arabia has been subdued in its reaction to iraqs invasion of kuwait which places iraqi forces near the oilrich kingdoms border
oil executives said saudi arabia has not and will not take the most potent action possible against iraq  closing the pipeline that carries iraqi oil for export across saudi arabia to the red sea
the executives said the saudis believe this would give iraqs belligerent president saddam hussein an excuse to attack and occupy saudi oil fields  miles south of kuwait giving iraq control of more oil than any other country in the world
the only direct saudi statement since the invasion was made by an anonymous government spokesman through the official saudi press agency the day after the iraqi move
the statement said saudi arabia was following the kuwait situation with extreme concern and that king fahd would be seeking to calm the situation and to find a solution in a manner ensuring the interests of all
the statement did not condemn the invasion
the only tangible help saudi arabia gave the kuwaiti government in the wake of the invasion was to shelter members of the ruling family including the emir sheik jaber alahmed alsabah and the crown prince
both nations are tightly run by royal families and have been close allies
the saudis also allowed the kuwaiti royal family to briefly operate a radio reportedly from a mobile van in the area around the saudikuwait border
but friday the radio went off the air after a desperate call the people of kuwait appeal to you oh brethren oh arabs oh beloved brothers oh moslems rush rush to their help
it was not known if the radio had been discovered by the iraqis or shut down by the saudis to avoid provoking saddam at a time when fears were being expressed that he might invade saudi arabia as well
saudi arabia borders kuwait and iraqs invasion forces were reportedly near the saudi border
the saudis did condemned the invasion as part of a joint statement issued by the gulf cooperation council in which it is allied with kuwait the united arab emirates qatar oman and bahrain
the six states issued a statement saying we strongly condemn and are very sorry for this attack that one arab state took against another arab state
 we do not recognize anything resulting from it
iraqs millionmember armed forces is clearly too much for the joint member gulf cooperation council force or saudi arabias member army
saudi arabia was also one of the  members of the member arab league that condemned the invasion in the same terms as the gulf cooperation council
the arab league with onethird of its members voting against the resolution or abstaining was clearly unable to take any direct action
turkey has also refused to take action and has not commented about president bushs suggestion that it cut off iraqs oil pipeline to the mediterranean
two parallel pipelines pump iraqi crude oil to a terminal at yumurtalik at the eastern corner of turkeys mediterranean coast and constitute iraqs major oil export outlet
australian novelist peter carey was awarded the coveted booker prize for fiction tuesday night for his love story oscar and lucinda
a panel of five judges unanimously announced the award of the  prize after an minute deliberation during a banquet at londons ancient guildhall
the judges made their selection from  books published in britain in the past  months and which they read in their homes
carey who lives in sydney with his wife and son said in a brief speech that like the other five finalists he had been asked to attend with a short speech in his pocket in case he won
if id known i was going to win i think i would have taken a bit more trouble with my handwriting he said as he stared down at his notes
he was unsuccessful in the prize competition in  when his novel illywhacker was among the final six
carey called the award a great honor and he thanked the prize sponsors for provoking so much passionate discussion about literature  perhaps there will be more tomorrow
everyone who loves good books benefits from this surely he added
the winning novel is a fitting choice for australias bicentennial year
it tells of a romance between an english gambler and an australian heiress who meet on a steamships maiden voyage to australia in the midth century
the story weaves in australian history from its founding in  by british immigrants
panel chairman michael foot a writer and former leader of the opposition labor party said the judges agreed that entries this year had been exceptionally strong and that choosing the last six novels was extremely difficult
we hope there will be no criticisms but if there are then people should start reading the books for themselves foot said
carey was the only nonbriton in the final six
the son of an auto dealer he was born in bacchus marsh victoria and attended geelong church of england grammar school melbourne where the prince of wales was also a pupil as an yearold in 
carey was an advertising copywriter before turning to writing books in 
the first booker prize was awarded in 
it is administered by book trust an educational charity promoting books and is sponsored by booker an international food and farming business

at least  people were killed in nepal said tek bahadur thapa additional secretary in the home affairs ministry

if god is pleased nothing will happen said one woman who refused to give her name
the earthquake which struck shortly before daybreak sunday when most people were still asleep registered  on the richter scale
it was the deadliest quake in the region since  when a temblor in the east indian state of assam killed  by official count and  by seismologists accounts
dharan  miles southeast of katmandu sits on a rolling plain at the base of a steep hill
at least  bodies have been found in the town of 
most of the victims died in their houses which were made of bricks held together by mud that had loosened during the seasonal monsoon rains
police inspector g adhikari said bulldozers have demolished more than  houses deemed too dangerous for habitation
we will continue to demolish houses until we are satisfied the ones remaining are safe to live in he said
british soldiers from a nearby gurkha recruiting center pitched in with cranes to aid the demolition
dharan is in the heart of regional famed for fierce gurkha fighters who have served in the british army for more than  years

with the winds of hurricane gilbert clocked at  miles per hour us weather officials called gilbert the most intense hurricane ever recorded in the western hemisphere
mark zimmer a meterologist at the national hurricane center reported an air force reconnaissance plane measured the barometric pressure at gilberts center at  inches at  pm edt on tuesday
gilbert was barreling toward mexicos yucatan peninsula
thats the lowest pressure ever measured in the western hemisphere zimmer said
the previous record low pressure of  inches was set by the  labor day hurricane that struck the florida keys with winds above  mph killing  people he said
with tropical storm force winds extending  miles north and  miles south of the hurricanes center gilbert also was one of the largest
but because the circumference of a hurricane changes so often during its course no records are kept on their overall size said center meterologist jesse moore
hurricane debby which barely crossed the  mph threshold to hurricane strength before striking mexico last month was probably about half that size moore said
gilbert is one of only three category  storms in the hemisphere since weather officials began keeping detailed records
the others were the  labor day hurricane and hurricane camille which bulldozed the mississippi coast with  mph winds and a foot wave in  leaving  billion in damage and  dead
a  hurricane is responsible for the worst natural disaster in us history however
that storm hit galveston texas sept  and killed more than  people
category  storms have winds greater than  mph barometric pressure of less than  inches and a storm surge higher than  feet
the storm surge  a great dome of water that follows the eye of the hurricane across coastlines bulldozing everything in its path  accounts for nine out of  hurricane fatalities
camilles storm surge was  feet high but the hurricane center was forecasting a surge of only  feet for gilbert zimmer said
the damage from these worstcase hurricanes is catastrophic  shrubs and trees blown down all street signs gone roofs and windows blown away and shattered and mobile homes destroyed
moisture and heat are what drives the hurricane zimmer said
the engine itself is this tall chimney of warm moist air in the center
if the atmospheric conditions in general allow this warm chimney to build to very high levels  miles high then you can have a severe hurricane
category  storms cause extreme damage with winds from  to  mph surge of  feet and pressure of  to 
the weakest hurricanes category  cause minimal damage with winds of  to  mph  foot surge and pressure at  or more
the  summer olympic games werent even over when advertisers began clamoring for pixie gymnast mary lou retton
she went on to grin relentlessly through some  million worth of commercial endorsements  surely an olympic record in itself
but when the  summer games ended sunday night so too did the chance for american athletes to follow in her footsteps
ad agency executives who spend every fourth year glued to their tv sets hoping to pick out the next star to hawk their clients products say that this olympiad was a dud
i suspect this will go down as the dullest in the history of the olympics says jerry della femina chairman of ad agency della femina mcnamee wcrs
this is the first olympics without passion and without passion you dont have testimonials
without heroes you dont have anyone that anyone wants to emulate
on the surface the games seemed to offer all the drama that usually makes for lucrative endorsement contracts
who could forget diver greg louganis smacking his head on the springboard then coming back to win two gold medals
or flamboyant florence griffith joyner her twoinch fingernails raking the air as she won the meter sprint
but even these two along with jackie joynerkersee who won the womens heptathalon and the long jump may find it more difficult than in previous years to turn gold medals into gold in the bank
the fact is say many marketers olympic gold has lost much of its commercial luster
i dont think its big money like it used to be says michael goldberg of national media group inc the new york sportsmarketing firm that represents ms retton
it used to be kind of a kneejerk reaction to do an ad campaign around an olympic athlete
it just doesnt happen anymore
certainly this years winning olympians will have no trouble securing contracts from specialized sportsequipment outfitters and speaking invitations from obscure trade groups
but the major highpaying endorsements  such as those with softdrink companies and fastfood outlets  just dont seem to be surfacing at least not yet
earlier this year sports marketers estimated that a gold medal won during the summer games could earn a personable athlete more than  million in endorsements
now marketers say these medalists will be lucky to pull in  to  a year
advertisers can reel off a litany of reasons why these olympics arent igniting much spark
for one thing they suffer by comparison with the  summer games so exciting because they were held in los angeles and because in the absence of boycotting sovietbloc countries the americans won  gold medals
the  games by contrast were broadcast from halfway around the world and the soviets trounced the americans  gold medals to 
whats more marketers say this years drug scandals cast a pall over the games especially the incident involving canadian sprinter ben johnson who lost his gold medal after testing positive for steroids
nbcs tv coverage also gets its share of the blame
marketers say it was so bland and skipped so frequently from one event to another that there was little chance for excitement to build
the constant commercial interruptions which led to ratings that were much lower than expected didnt help either
during most of the past games there was enough continuous tv coverage so that much like a soap opera it was possible to get involved in the lives and in the competition says leigh steinberg attorney for iceskater brian boitano a gold medalist at the  winter games
but not this summer he says
recent changes in olympic rules meanwhile have led to a glut of olympians in search of endorsement deals
before the  games most olympic athletes werent allowed to make commercials unless they gave up their amateur status
now they can appear in as many ads as they want but the income must go into a trust fund for training expenses
every year more and more olympic people are out there wanting to do commercials  basically everybody is available says daisy sinclair a vice president with ad agency ogilvy group inc as a result while once an aura surrounded an olympian now the bloom is off
companies also are becoming more sophisticated in their approach to celebrity endorsements
increasingly cost conscious they will no longer hook up with an olympian just because the company president likes the athletes sport
and after years of paying big bucks to olympic stars only to see them fade into obscurity companies have finally gotten the hint that olympian fame is of the most fleeting variety
if you think your phone will ring off the hook if you win a gold medal it isnt going to happen anymore says stephen disson senior vice president of marketing for proserv inc a washington sportsmarketing firm
companies now know that six months from now there will be other heroes from other sporting events for them to consider
ad agency bbdo worldwides attitude toward the olympics is becoming typical
it uses sports stars in its commercials for pepsi light and oppenheimer mutual funds but has no plans to call on any of s olympians
i prefer to use athletes who are in the public eye on a regular basis like football and basketball players says charles miesmer the agencys executive creative director
people like michael jordan have plus years in their sports careers all in a row so i dont have to worry about the public saying carl who
and dont look for any of s winners to start showing up on wheaties boxes either
general mills inc which has featured ms retton and decathalon goldmedalist bruce jenner on its wheaties boxes in the past says it looks for three qualities in an endorser career achievement popular appeal and offthefield accomplishments
a spokeswoman says that none of this years crop meet all three criteria
so far ms joynerkersee has had the most visible endorsements
even before the olympics began she had made commercials for primatene mist and up
and according to her agent pearl hodge of world class management she is now in the process of signing with mcdonalds corp to work on behalf of its efforts to aid underprivileged children
ms joynerkersees sisterinlaw ms griffith joyner may soon take the endorsement lead
advertisers say with her good looks and fashion flare she is attracting more interest than any of the other medal winners
the sprinters manager couldnt be reached for comment
another olympian with endorsement potential is swimmer matt biondi who won five gold medals
mr biondi has already signed a swimwear contract with arena usa inc and parkes brittain his agent at advantage international inc says his client will definitely be in a highincome ring the highest you can name
then there is mr louganis
since winning two gold medals during the  summer olympics the diver has had little luck with major endorsements
and a few marketing executives say that even his second sweep of the diving events may not up his potential
when most advertisers are looking for the male hero the word macho trails along very closely says marty blackman of blackman  raber a sportsmarketing firm in new york
i dont find louganis a macho guy
still other marketing professionals say that mr louganiss dramatic recovery after smashing his head has secured the divers future
his manager jim babbitt wont comment on any contract offers
he will say however that his client has done just fine
he isnt unhappy
he dives to perform he doesnt dive for dollars
 winning endorsements there is only one former olympian among the top sports endorsers of last year

two corporate executives sat down in an office here last month to talk business with a bunch of clowns
the subject was no laughing matter but rather the serious endeavor of finding south koreas ronald mcdonald
seven years after the us hamburger giant first tried to bring its big macs to south korea the golden arches were finally going up
mcahn industries ltd recently opened the first of what it expects will be a string of burger outlets in seoul
the company is a  joint venture of mcdonalds corp oak brook ill and an accountantturnedentrepreneur ahn hyo young
mcdonalds is flourishing in  other nations in the region
but its entry into south korea which has asias fastestgrowing economy had been frustrated by its inability to find a suitable partner and to win agreement from seoul on terms
south korea may be one of mcdonalds most promising foreign markets business analysts say
the country is developing an essential ingredient for the success of a fastfood enterprise a middle class
hamburgerrelated fastfood sales in south korea totaled  million last year a  rise from  according to the ministry of finance
analysts say this years rise could be much bigger helped by a  increase in wages in mid and another big pay increase expected soon
the business is likely to profit from the  olympic games in seoul in september and from an anticipated postolympic economic boom here
however the competition is heating up and there is a good possibility that south korea already has reached the fastfood saturation point for its current average income bracket an official for the south korea chamber of commerce and industry says
the competition besides wendys internationals  shops and six of burger king a unit of pillsbury co includes homegrown burger chains
mcdonalds strategy is to take things slowly avoiding extravagances mr ahn and awad sifri mcdonalds marketing director say
we are starting small says mr ahn
were hoping to open three outlets this year and five next year
after that wed like to open five every year
equally modest he says will be the initial menu no breakfast no chicken mcnuggets and no products tailored to national tastes as offered elsewhere
the venture is rejecting television commercials in favor of a cheaper more oldfashioned approach a brief advertising campaign in newspapers distribution of fliers and word of mouth
mr sifri says the emphasis will be on developing mcdonalds image as an affordable place for the emerging middle class rather than as a familiar name for foreigners in south korea
attention will be given to attracting children he adds
mr ahn says mcdonalds talked to  potential partners before choosing the harvardtrained accountant in 
two years later mcdonalds and mr ahn each put up  million in capital and borrowed an additional  million to form mcahn
mcdonalds struggled with the government over mcahns royalty payments to the us partner  the issue was resolved  and over tight import restrictions on food products
the import question came down to finding a supplier locally who could supply highquality beef and potatoes at a value mcdonalds said
even mcdonalds golden arches symbol ran into red tape since the city regulates the size and color of signs
it may be against the law but were putting them up anyway mr ahn says
the un security council today overwhelmingly approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against iraq including a ban on oil purchases to punish baghdad for invading kuwait
the vote was  with two abstentions by cuba and yemen on the member council which adopted the sanctions resolution proposed by the united states
it said iraq had launched an armed attack against kuwait and usurped the authority of kuwaits legitimate government
the sanctions were intended to force iraq to withdraw its troops from kuwait and the resolution bans the import into their territories of all commodities and products originating in iraq or kuwait and exported there from after the date of this resolution
president bush praised the decision and called for full and total implementation of these sanctions ruling out nothing at all
he told reporters at the white house the will of nations around the world will be to enforce these sanctions
it was the third time in its year existence that the world body had voted sanctions against a member state
the last time was  when the security council voted similar comprehensive sanctions against the white minority government of rhodesia
an arms embargo against south africa still is in effect
the sanctions are legally binding for all member nations although past council resolutions have often been ignored or flouted
the united nations has no enforcement mechanism but later could call on members to take military action against iraq or impose a blockade
the vote followed similar sanctions imposed on iraq by much of the west including the united states japan and the european community
the soviet union and china said they would halt arms shipments to iraq
in a statement carried by the iraqi news agency on sunday the iraqiinstalled military government of kuwait warned other nations not to take punishing measures against it or iraq
the provisional government said countries have to remember they have interests and citizens in kuwait
the un role in the iraqkuwait crisis assumed increasing importance after divided arab nations canceled a weekend emergency summit on the invasion
in an emergency session just hours after thursdays invasion the security council condemned iraqs invasion demanded immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal and called for negotiations between iraq and kuwait
the council threatened to impose sanctions if iraq did not comply
the council includes the five permanent members with veto power  the united states britain china france and the soviet union
the  nonpermanent members are canada colombia cuba ethiopia finland ivory coast malaysia romania yemen and zaire

it is not an irrational fear of the kind that one explains away as the nightmares of victims who remain locked into their past and lose all perspective of present reality
the fears are real because those who bear the scars of the last unified germany do not see their concerns being addressed in the current reunification discussions betwen world leaders
hier listed  points he wanted to raise
among them were a program to teach german schoolchildren about the annhilation of the jews the creation of an agency to monitor and prosecute hate groups the continuation of the special relationship now existing between west germany and israel the convening of a  conference of world leaders on the th anniversary of the conference at which the final solution was developed the establisment of a german commission to protect holocaust sites the banning of terrorist organizations that have enjoyed respectablity in east germany a cultural exchange program between german and jewish organizations german television and radio programs on the reconciliation restitution payments to the families and victims of nazism and a german commitment to revitalize former synagogues in east german territory
ground controllers at the goddard space flight center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the  billion hubble space telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on
applause erupted in the hubble control center in greenbelt md as the glitch that marred hubbles first full day in space was solved
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna system said nasas dave drachlis
engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the tdrs an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard
in the successful attempt they nearly doubled the width of the antennas beams to take in more territory from a sweep of  degrees to  degrees
the telescopes lowgain antennas which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies were working well
space shuttle discovery was  miles away available to remedy certain problems
the outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned
the five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over texas from their milehigh perch and doing experiments
steve terry director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem
it began between  and  am edt and lasted  minutes to an hour he said
the second failure occurred at  am when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescopes two highgain antennas through the tdrs
this time it was a pointing problem said jim elliott a goddard spokesman
its a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause
the telescope embarking on a year search for new worlds was released from the shuttles cargo bay wednesday after a lastminute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk
mission control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song shout a fraternity house favorite
good morning discovery
i guess youre awake after that song said kathy thornton shuttle communicator
there are a lot of happy people down here
we saw a great deploy yesterday and hubble had a good night while you were asleep
we appreciate the good words from everybody replied discovery commander loren shriver
after wednesdays deployment shriver gently backed discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers the last one completed this morning to park discovery in orbit  miles behind hubble
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work shriver said wednesday
well it sure is now loren and thanks for all the great work youve done replied mission control
galileo is real proud of you
scientists have hailed the hubble  nasas most expensive unmanned spacecraft  as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the goddard center make sure hubble is operating properly such as responding to directional commands
the next milestone is friday when the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
then on tuesday nasa expects to release the first image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina
data will follow in a month or two
if the aperture door doesnt open properly discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it
hubble project manager fred wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
too much light could damage the telescopes sensitive instruments
on wednesday mission specialist steve hawley used the shuttles foot robot arm to gently grasp the ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay
one of the telescopes solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge
but there was trouble with the second panel
it wouldnt budge when the latches were released and then moved about a fifth of its foot length and stopped again
the panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt
by the final attempt astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock  minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outerspace maintenance call
wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown
the hour procedure was performed  miles above earth  miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown
the orbit was dictated by the need to put hubble above the earths distorting atmosphere
astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billions years to reach earth
they hope to determine how and when the universe was formed currently estimated at  billion years ago
the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in  but was delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident
discovery which blasted into orbit tuesday is scheduled to land sunday at edwards air force base calif
leopold gratz the president of parliament and one of the most powerful politicians in the socialist party resigned today over a scandal surrounding the mysterious sinking of ship  years ago
gratz  is the second senior socialist official to step down because of his alleged involvement in the socalled lucona scandal the subject of a widely publicized investigation by a parliamentary committee
interior minister karl blecha like gratz a onetime protege of former chancellor bruno kreisky resigned jan
blecha and gratz have denied wrongdoing or aiding udo proksch the prime suspect in the sinking of the ship lucona in the indian ocean
six sailors died
the luconas cargo was officially described by proksch as for a uranium processing plant and insured for  million
the insurance company has never paid claiming the cargo was only scrap metal and alleging the vessel was intentionally sunk to collect the insurance money
proksch wanted by austrian justice on suspicion of murder and insurance fraud has been variously described to be living in syria the philippines and latin america
in several interviews gratz described himself as a close friend of proksch but when proksch fled to escape prosecution gratz criticized him
gratz told parliament today he would give up his seat in february hence his post as president one of the most prestigious posts in austria
my decision is a personal one and it is politically motivated gratz told the house
if it becomes impossible for the president to effectively take a stand on significant issues or to speak up on problems of parliamentarism because everybody is only interested in his context in a single other topic then he cannot serve the national council parliament in such a way as is his duty
in past newspaper stories gratz was accused of providing fabricated evidence from abroad to help proksch in his claim that the controversial shipment was for a uranium processing plant
gratz who denied the allegations was also accused of helping proksch in several other ways
like blecha gratz is to appear before the parliamentary investigation committee
the death toll from last weeks flash floods mounted to  today when a body was found in the ohio river and authorities said there was little hope for the  people still listed as missing
its just been too long
i dont think theres anybody alive out there
you cant swim out there that long in the ohio river said chuck vogt belmont county coroners investigator
the search for the missing was suspended briefly this morning when a thunderstorm rolled through the area
heavy rain fell for about  minutes swelling wegee creek one of two creeks that overflowed in thursday nights flash flood
by midmorning the muddy creek was nearly crossing a road about three miles upstream from where the floods inflicted the most damage
lt dean irvin of the ohio army national guard said there were no immediate reports of additional property damage
the body found this morning was in the ohio river near moundsville wva about  miles south of shadyside according to chuck vogt belmont county coroners investigator
the number of names on the list of missing dropped from  to  with the identities of three victims and a call by one person alerting authorities that she was safe vogt said
one of the recovered bodies remains unidentified
authorities are not ruling out the possibility that other people not on the list could be missing
four bodies were recovered sunday
officials said friday that  people were missing some of those later were found dead while others notified authorities that they were safe and officials learned that still more had moved out of the area
wegee and pipe creeks overflowed during storms that dumped  inches of rain in  hours
the floods destroyed as many as  houses and damaged up to  others
most of those whose homes and belongings were swept away by the wall of water will have to put their lives back together largely without benefit of insurance
few people in the coalmining and steelmaking area carried flood insurance and homeowners insurance will not cover damage from thursdays flood residents and insurers said
we didnt think we needed to have flood insurance
that creek never flooded
everybody just got wiped out said julia kulazenka
rainwater running down hillsides had forced debris into the creeks and formed dams at bridges spanning them shadyside fire chief mark badia said
eventually the bridges couldnt hold any more
the debris broke loose and thats when we got three big gushes of water badia said
the home mrs kulazenka shared with her husband until his death last july was damaged as wegee creek raged out of control
she said replacing a machine shop garage deck and automobiles she and her son owned would cost more than 
they told us homeowners wont do us no good
so unless the government helps us rebuild i dont know what ill do with this place mrs kulazenka said
the federal emergency management agency said it will open an office tuesday in shadyside to accept applications from residents for lowinterest loans and grants to help them rebuild
before the flood land in the wegee creek valley fetched handsome prices said kulazenkas son charles kulazenka
that was especially welcome to residents many of whom were either retired or laid off from jobs in coal mines in belmont county where unemployment in april was  percent
ground was at a premium down here before this because it was just outside the city limits of shadyside
it was quiet and peaceful and people were looking to buy and build new homes out here
now you couldnt give it away kulazenka said
but we cant be bitter though because weve got our lives and a lot of our neighbors real close buddies werent that lucky
forty years after sam walton first hung out his shingle waltons  will reopen to show how a little rural storekeeper built a discount retail empire
walmart stores incs visitors center opens wednesday in the same building on the downtown square where walton first opened for business on may  
the center chronicles the rise of the nations fastestgrowing discount chain using displays and audiovideo presentations
it concentrates on how the free enterprise system works and how walmart thrived when similar companies didnt
the window displays date back to the stores opening with simplicity patterns and johnsons glocoat a box of dreft and some ivory snow
inside an electronic map details the companys plus store chain today
also on display at the center is the hula skirt that sam walton donned for his dance on wall street which he performed after challenging the company to reach a record  percent pretax profit in 
the goal was accomplished and he danced
the old and the modern together reflect the corporate culture of the nations biggest discount retailer behind k mart corp of detroit
walton and his brother bud opened the first walmart discount city in 
both will be on hand for the opening along with a sprinkling of other dignitaries including gov
bill clinton the dedication speaker
aside from the other displays and presentations the center also has a replica of sam waltons original office at the store including many fixtures he used  years ago
also on display is a photograph of young sam walton a fatfaced baby born in oklahoma in the s
typical of the walmart outlook dust bowl oklahoma is termed a place to grow and to dream in a video on the walton family
after a stint with jc penney co and the army he opened a ben franklin store in newport in 
he lost the lease on that one and relocated to bentonville
thats where the story took off
sam walton convinced bob bogle then a public health officer to take over management of his bentonville ben franklin store in 
walton said he wanted to put in about a dozen stores and needed someone to tend the shop in bentonville while he and his brother built a chain of ben franklins bogle said in a recent interview
thats when bogle found himself in waltons learn as you go training program
i got home at  oclock that night after scrubbing and waxing the floor with sam bogle said
inauspicious first impressions are part of the story
in one video david glass who succeeded sam walton as chief executive of walmart in  recalled his impressions after attending the opening of the second walmart discount city at harrison in 
the first store at rogers opened two years earlier
i thought to myself this is absolutely the worst discount store or retail store i have ever seen said glass who was president of a drugstore chain at the time
and walmart vice chairman donald soderquist recalls that when walton took his idea of putting discount stores in rural areas to ben franklin headquarters in chicago officials there just really didnt see a future in it
don shinkle walmarts director of corporate and public affairs attributed walmarts success to its associates  the term for employees first coined in  to stress that all walmart employees are partners in the company  and to sam waltons leadership and knack for hiring the right person at the right time
at the start of  walmart owned  stores employed  and listed sales of  billion
sams wholesale club closed out the year with  units and walmart announced plans to enter the california market
the government has decided to give ethnic germans and crimean tatars who were expelled from their homelands by josef stalin their own autonomous regions but it will take years tass reported wednesday
the ice has been broken
a start has been made
were working on creating such autonomy said rafik nishanov chairman of a chamber of the soviet legislature in remarks carried by the official news agency
however he said the nuts and bolts of how to create the regions still had to be worked out
for example a year program on resettlement
people cant just be expelled from the area for others to move in
the tatars of the crimea and the ethnic germans who lived on the volga river were forcibly resettled during world war ii when josef stalin kicked peoples out of their homelands on the grounds they could not be trusted to occupy strategic areas
the tatars and germans among others long have been agitating to return from siberia and central asia to their traditional lands and last month the supreme soviet legislature declared that all peoples exiled under stalin should be considered politically rehabilitated
but other people now occupy the lands and houses that belonged to the exiles and reestablishing their dominion in their home regions will not be so simple
the supreme soviet took the basic decision that the two autonmous regions should be created on nov  but kept it quiet apparently fearing explosive reactions from the populations now living in the regions
it was also a potentially dangerous precedent the soviet union is a patchwork of well over  ethnic groups and many of them have outstanding territorial claims
trouble already has been reported between ethnic germans and russians in several cities on the volga
residents of the saratov and volgograd regions have protested the prospect of seeing many of the nations estimated  million germans descending on them
ethnographers estimate there are some  crimean tatars in the soviet union and another  million in turkey
their protests near the kremlin in  demanding to be allowed to return to their homeland were among the first tests of president mikhail s gorbachevs promises of greater democracy
several thousand tatars have been filtering back to the crimea each year despite the lack of wholesale permission to return
a wave of some  ethnic germans emigrated to west germany this year but many would probably stay if they could be assured of their own republic said irina ostroukh a researcher at the soviet institute of ethnography who studies ethnic germans
the nov  plan approved by the supreme soviet recommended excluding from the german region areas where resistance to german resettlement was strongest in order to avoid ethnic conflicts
the explosive conflict between armenians and azerbaijanis over the nagornokarabakh region has led to  deaths and hundreds of thousands of refugees in the last two years
both sides claim control over the mountainous enclave
the supreme soviet charged the government with creating a commmission to determine how to create the regions for the germans and crimean tatars
the most intense hurricane on record surged toward texas today after battering the yucatan peninsula with  mph winds leveling slums pummeling posh resorts and forcing tens of thousands to flee
hurricane gilbert which has left nearly one in four jamaicans homeless slackened somewhat as it swirled over land but the storm was beginning to gain strength over open water as it moved toward the us gulf coast with sustained winds of  mph
the storm was headed west northwest said national hurricane center director bob sheets
it was moving at  mph and dumping up to  inches of rain
the area that we have the most likely possibility that this hurricane will make landfall is in the northern part of mexico or the southeastern southern part of texas he said
at  pm today the center of the storm was near latitude  north and longitude  west or about  miles southeast of brownsville texas the national weather service said
brownsville was given a  percent probability of being hit though a hurricane watch was in effect along the entire texas coast as well as the northeastern mexican coast from tampico
earlier this week the storm struck the carribean ravaging jamaica the dominican repubic the cayman islands and haiti killing at least  in jamaica and five in the dominican republic
haiti declared a state of emergency across its southern peninsula where at least  hurricanerelated deaths have been reported
the storm about  miles wide hit the yucatan coast at dawn wednesday thrashing beaches with foot waves uprooting trees knocking out electricity and water supplies and severing telephone lines
mexican officials reported at least seven injuries
there were no reports of deaths
gilbert battered the provincial capital of merida and the gulf port cities of puerto progreso campeche and ciudad del carmen closing airports and roads and knocking out communications and power and innundating streets and highways
about  people were evacuated from puerto progreso and other coastal towns a spokesman for the interior ministry in mexico city said by telephone today
hundreds of homes were destroyed he said
the ministry said the storm seriously damaged the luxury hotel zone in the resort of cancun and destroyed about a quarter of the homes on the nearby island of cozumel
ham radio operators in mexico city also told the associated press they had reports of massive damage to several hotels
authorities were particularly concerned about the people trapped on another resort island just off cancun tiny isla mujeres
a navy spokesman in mexico city said he had no word on the plight of an estimated  people stranded there
three ferries linking the island with the mainland were lost in the storm but there were no reports of casualties
in campeche boats were driven onto the street running along the waterfront ramon castillo a night watchman at the newspaper novedades of campeche said in a telephone interview
there is no light there is no radio there is nothing
there is much damage
the whole city is flooded he said
sheets said the hurricane was expected to hit land midday friday and that its sustained winds would today certainly increase to   miles per hour
its going to have an impact over a fairly large area sheets said on cbstvs this morning
those major destructive winds are going to be in there fairly tight close to the center
but the impacts are going to be felt over most of the texas area
the hurricane center said gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure which was measured at  inches breaking the  inches recorded for the  hurricane that devastated the florida keys
in the yucatan state capital of merida the storms  mph winds destroyed nearly all the thatched houses in one district uprooted trees road signs and cut off water supplies said gonzalez correa news editor of novedades
a spokeswoman with the national civil defense system in mexico city said at least  people had flocked to merida from coastal areas
civil defense officials said  tourists left beachside motels and  local people also sought temporary shelter
us consular officials said they did not know how many tourists were in cancun which receives about  visitors per month
the storm spawned saturday southeast of puerto rico appeared to have hit jamaica the hardest
that island nations prime minister edward seaga said wednesday that it destroyed about  of jamaicas  homes
he estimated damage at  billion
earlier wednesday gilbert was classified as a category  storm the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane
such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than  mph and can cause catastrophic damage
by wednesday night the national hurricane center downgraded it to a category  and to a category  by this morning
only two category  hurricanes have hit the united states  the  storm that killed  people in florida and hurricane camille which devastated the mississippi coast in  and killed  people

the senate foreign relations committee today endorsed the nomination of michigan republican activist peter f secchia as ambassador to italy but the panels chairman said he feared secchia might embarrass the united states because of his penchant for making gross remarks
the committees vote was  in favor of secchia a former republican national committeeman for michigan and lumber industry executive

pell inserted into the hearing record newspaper accounts containing the distasteful specifics of mr secchias remarks
at his confirmation hearing earlier this month secchia pledged to be far more careful as a diplomat in his use of colorful language than he had been in his different role as a political organizer and enthusiast
but pell said he was unpersuaded
tact and careful speech are hallmarks of successful diplomats pell said
mr secchia has demonstrated that he would bring opposite qualities to the position of ambassador to italy
italian friends of mine telephoned me from rome aghast at the prospect of having mr secchia represent the united states in their country the chairman said
i believe that this nomination is a mistake and in all likelihood mr secchia will be an embarrasment to the administration and the united states pell said
but he said that since secchia is the presidents choice he would not try to block the nomination or delay action on it

july   iraqi president saddam hussein accuses kuwait and the united arab emirates of flooding the oil market and driving prices down and that the move cost iraq  billion in lost oil revenue
he further charges that arab states in the persian gulf are conspiring with the united states and israel to weaken iraqs economy and undermine its military buildup
july   iraq accuses kuwait of stealing  billion worth of oil from wells along the disputed border with iraq and of seeking to wreck iraqs economy by overproducing oil and thus pushing down prices

john lennon spent much of a threeyear span tucked away in his room sleeping or sitting in a lotus position with his head enveloped in tobacco or marijuana smoke according to a biography of the slain beatle
an excerpt from the book the lives of john lennon by journalist and biographer albert goldman appearing in the aug  issue of people magazine discloses a sometimes unflattering portrait of both lennon and his second wife yoko ono
the book is scheduled to be published later this month by william morrow  co inc
between  and  goldman writes lennon could not be more remote
apart from a few hours in the morning and evening including time spent with his son sean lennon is back here in his room alone and silent
the author says the idolized beatle spent most of his adult life as an anorexic starving himself to what he perceived as perfection
the onset of the eating disorder can be traced to  goldman writes when some fool described him in print as the fat beatle
 that phrase struck such a blow to his fragile ego that the wound has never healed
lennon rarely wore clothing other than a pair of backless slippers and avoided touching anyone according to the book
the page biography also details yoko onos aweek heroin habit in 
she reportedly snorted the drug
according to the book lennon also took heroin and consumed a great deal of lsd
i must have taken a thousand trips the book quotes lennon as saying
i just ate it all the time like candy
goldman spent more than six years researching the book interviewing  friends relatives and associates of lennon who was murdered eight years ago in new york
workers at kghm polands copper producing combine went on strike yesterday as coal mining unions staged token stoppages in a third of the countrys pits in a major challenge to the governments economic policies
the strike at kghm in lubin western poland where mining unions representing some  workers have been demanding a  per cent wage increase came despite a management offer at the weekend to increase wages by  per cent
further increases could only come if the government eased prohibitive wage control taxes thus providing a powerful precedent for wage demands by other groups
meanwhile coal mining unions are also demanding wage increases as well as a clear restructuring strategy for their industry after last weeks scattered stoppages in some  of polands  pits wrung promises of wage rises that cash strapped managements can ill afford
in contrast to the copper industry which continues to show a profit coal mining is running at a loss with subsidies stopped in march as the government moved to control the budget deficit
the industry is experiencing a coal glut with pit head power station and export stocks amounting to some m tonnes the equivalent of a months output
this has led to temporary layoffs which have hit miners incomes and led to the present bout of unrest
polish mines produced m tonnes of coal in the first half of the year or  per cent less than in the same period last year
meanwhile kghm produced  tonnes of refined copper in the same period or  per cent more than in the first half of 
the crippling drought hitting north america is expected to reduce world grain stocks to levels that may cause food shortages in many poor countries the un food and agriculture organization reported today
the agency projects world cereal production in  to total  billion tons only two million tons more than last years level which was already below the expected production
if the drought in the united states ended now grain production would fall close to the low levels of  when a drought and farmers participation in a government crop reduction program decreased output the agency reported
as a result world grain stocks are projected to fall below  million tons or  percent of the level the agency considers necessary to safeguard world food security the report said
if crop conditions in the united states and canada continue to deteriorate the ratio could drop even further
such a development would have serious implications for the food security particularly of many lowincome fooddeficit countries the report said
the high grain prices resulting from a lower supply would hit poor foodimporting countries the hardest the un agency warned
it said the rising prices could also reduce food aid from developed countries
the most severely hit crops are coarse grains  mostly maize barley and oats the report said

in asia the yearly monsoon rains started on time and production in europe and the soviet is expected to be larger than last year
grain production in south america should be slightly lower this year than last
in the sahel region of subsaharan africa however locusts flourishing in unexpectedly heavy rains have damaged this years harvest
potential crop losses from the pests could hit  million tons fao said
jubilant astronomers saw decades of work take wing tuesday as the hubble space telescope was boosted high above earth to launch a great adventure for mankind
charles robert odell a rice university space physicist who has worked  years on hubble said seeing it hurled into orbit aboard the shuttle capped an experience that was comparable to raising a child
ive been with the program since it was a concept
there is nothing better than to see  years of my work and five of my friends thrust into orbit he said
colin norman a physics and astronomy professor at johns hopkins university and academic affairs director of the space telescope science institute there called the launch the perfect start to a great adventure for mankind
it was incredibly beautiful
the power of the launch was awesome and the telescope has an awesome power norman said
discoverys liftoff was especially gratifying since it ended seven years of delays
the  billion telescope originally was scheduled for launch in  but remained grounded by technical problems and the challenger explosion
two weeks ago when hundreds of scientists crowded into the kennedy space center the launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff
only a few dozen of them returned tuesday but they were just as excited
there were times when we were deeply depressed
there were times when we were elated about hubbles progress said william h jeffreys a university of texas astronomer and hubbles astrometry project leader
jeffreys said
this is one of those times when we are thrilled beyond belief
ed weiler nasa program scientist for hubble said watching the liftoff was a double whammy because it was my first shuttle launch and the launch of the hst

try to think of sundays los angeles marathon less as a happening which it surely is or a worldclass athletic event which it may become but is not now
look at it more as a moving advertising opportunity human billboards running  miles through the city on live television
with that kind of exposure to a potential  million southern californians its no wonder that in only five years the l a marathon has become the bestmarketed slickest most modern and sponsordriven of the worlds major marathons
it may not be an overstatement that the l a marathon is one of the countrys bestmarketed sports events of any kind
depending on your point of view this may or may not be good news
massive marketing campaigns and major sponsors lining up for a seat on the money wagon do not make l a an elite race give it prestige or attract the worlds best runners
however they do generate a tremendous amount of money for all concerned
and that may yet transform this race if  as marathon president bill burke said this week  the total purse of  is increased by  next year and significantly more money is added for appearance fees to lure top athletes
the lineup of commercial support is impressive
the race has mercedesbenz of north america as its presenting sponsor making it one of  companies that have not only paid the race organizers to be called sponsors but have also put more money into the race either outright or by providing products and services
mercedes provides automobiles for the top male and female finishers
the times is one of the races more generous sponsors
according to will kern director of times special events this years marathon has received almost  worth of donated advertising space
for this the newspaper has received more than  in contributions to the times fund charity kern said
in addition the marathon sells its name to licensees and suppliers who donate everything from fruit and water to the official salted snack and the official hairgrowth product
the races marketingoriented philosophy can be traced to burke and marathon vice president marie patrick
it was because of our backgrounds in business said patrick who came to the marathon from sports marketing in tennis
were not runners never have been
we knew that you have to have big dollars in the beginning
from there you can move forward to be a major event
burke and patrick have formed a persuasive and successful recruiting team
according to mary reiling national event manager for att the la marathons sponsorfriendly approach is a big incentive
ive worked a lot of events with a lot of different promoters but they are by far the most creative group ive ever seen she said
mercedesbenz which also sponsors marathons in new york and san francisco likes the fact that the race gives them a foothold in their no
 market
the whole marketing approach of bill burke is great for sponsors said linda paulmeno manager of press relations for mercedesbenz
the whole race is very marketingoriented
the race depends on sponsors for the bulk of its operating budget which supports a yearround fulltime staff
patrick said the cost to sponsors varies from the midsixfigure range to over  million
the fees depend on the services and products offered by a firm
tradeouts are common
the marathon receives several hundred thousand dollars from kcop channel  for the television rights and the race has also been sold to cable and will be covered by radio
the sponsors also work together for mutual benefit
for example att is buying commercial time on channel s broadcast and channel  is providing updates on the att friendship cup an international race within the race
in fact television makes the race more attractive to sponsors who figure to multiply their exposure
richard lipeles president of pacificare health systems said sponsorship in the race helps separate his company in a congested healthcare market
also the company provides headbands to all runners
certainly wed love it if every runner wore our headband during the race he said
oscar selection has come under scrutiny as film studios go to new lengths to pull votes out of the academy of motion picture arts and sciences
and with the flood of oscar vote enticements  from free coffee mugs to complimentary buffet dinners  academy members are acknowledging that some oscar voting is done by committee in violation of the rules
secretaries spouses and friends several academy members say are marking ballots in what is supposed to be the entertainment industrys most esteemed awards competition
its like a local election of judges said academy member harry clein who said hes witnessed team voting
a lot of people dont know who the candidates are
so they take a look at whos around them and see what the consensus is
as far as elections go its not bad
but ive never been through an election in argentina
dan lyle who oversees the oscar balloting for the accounting firm price waterhouse inc said that there is no guarantee that academy members have actually filled out their own ballots
all we know is that a properly numbered ballot has been returned he said
members are on the honor system to fill out the ballot themselves
more than  members were given ballots this year for the st annual academy awards which will be telecast on march  from the shrine auditorium in los angeles
academy members vote on their area of specialty
the academys actors branch for example is the only group to select nominees in the four acting categories
since the voting is done secretly  members do not sign their ballots  the ballots authenticity is ensured solely by a numeric control number lyle said
ballots are invalidated only if there is more than one vote in a given category and only the votes in that specific category are not tallied he said
nominations for acting directing art direction and all specialized categories are handled by select branches and committees composed of academy members
all voting members of the academy can participate in the best picture nominations and may vote for the final awards in all categories
winners for best documentary feature best animated short film and best liveaction short film are chosen by only those members who have seen all the nominees
academy constituent julian blaustein said that most of his colleagues take the voting very seriously
i dont even vote in a category if im not familiar with the pictures in that category
 and ive never told someone to vote for a film even when ive done some of them
meanwhile other oscar voting rules are perhaps being broken speculates veteran academy member millard kaufman
although youre asked to vote in the nominations for five pictures i think a lot of people figure out that they have a better chance if they just vote for their own picture and leave the other four blank he said
given the tremendous impact both an oscar nomination and an oscar victory have on a films fortunes its not entirely surprising that a certain degree of artifice might surround the oscars
the last emperor took in  million close to half the films gross after it won last years best picture trophy
more than  percent of the revenues generated by s best picture platoon came after the film was nominated
on average a best picture award is worth about  million these days
a  oscar promotional campaign mounted by a studio therefore can be a good investment
in the case of this years awards a flurry of academyoriented newspaper advertisements banquets complimentary gifts and photo mailings tied to five late releases appears to have been remarkably successful
this year all best picture nominees and the large majority of top acting nominees came from movies released in december the accidental tourist dangerous liaisons rain man and working girl were all released after dec 
while these five movies might be good the nearly complete exclusion of films from the rest of the year has highlighted the studios mastery of oscar marketing
i think the academy awards are crap said terry gilliam director of brazil and the current the adventures of baron munchausen
its about selling films is all its about he said
its one more way of flogging some films
when brazil got nominated in  they asked me to be a member of the academy
and i wouldnt join
i just dont want to be a part of that at all
and at least one prominent academy member director carl reiner says that the manipulation of oscar voters has reached new depths
reiner said that universal studios allout effort to bag votes for sigourney weaver a best actress nominee for gorillas in the mist could lead him to vote against the film
i have in my house more color reproductions of sigourney weaver and a beautiful gorilla than i need reiner said of promotional material sent to his home
weve got to tell the academy to stop this advertising
im getting turned off on the pictures i like

within minutes cranley onslow chairman of the conservative party committee that supervised the election announced that another ballot was not required and that major was elected
thatcher left her residence at  downing street to congratulate major who as chancellor of the exchequer is her nextdoor neighbor at no
queen elizabeth ii will send for major and ask him to form a cabinet after thatcher has handed in her seals of office at buckingham palace on wednesday morning
major was elected to parliament in  was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year
he attracted support from prominent figures on the right wing of the conservative party although his friends insisted that majors own views are more liberal than many supposed
he described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues
major epitomized the selfreliant hardworking achiever whom thatcher encouraged
born march   the son of a circus performer he left school at  and was a laborer and at one time a welfare recipient
major became a banker and a conservative party activist and was elected to parliament in the first thatcher victory of 
he was appointed to a junior ministerial post in  then to the no

iraq struck back against the west today rounding up hundreds of foreign nationals in kuwait as the un security council overwhelming approved sweeping trade and military sanctions against iraq to punish it for invading the emirate
the iraqi invaders scoured hotels looking for some of the thousands of westerners based in kuwait or caught by the invasion
more than  million foreigners live and work in kuwait
several hundred britons americans and west germans were grabbed in the hotels and some were taken to iraq the west german and british foreign ministries said
britain said baghdad had given no reason for detaining  people most of them passengers from a british airways flight stranded at kuwait airport by the invasion
the un sanctions which included a ban on oil purchases came on a vote of  to  on the member council
cuba and yemen abstained on the resolution which was proposed by the united states
the iraqiinstalled kuwait government had earlier warned foreign countries that they should not forget their citizens in kuwait while heaping on economic punishments and todays roundup appeared to be a reaction against the sanctions
iraqi troops rolled into its new jerseysized neighbor thursday conquering the capital and moving south toward the saudi arabian border
persian gulf oil sources said today that they had seen saudi troops moving north toward the kuwaiti frontier near the oil port of khafji but the saudis denied that they had sent reinforcements to the border
iraqi authorities today told turkeys staterun pipeline company that one of the twin pipelines that carry baghdads oil through turkey will be closed for reasons of marketing officials said
world oil prices soared to their highest level in more than four years today as more countries joined the attempt to strangle baghdads economy and force it to withdraw its invasion troops
iraqs oil revenues totaled more than  billion last year
it has been pressing for higher oil prices to rebuild an economy damaged by the  war with iran and settle foreign debts of up to  billion
one of the reasons iraq gave for invading kuwait was kuwaiti reluctance to slow its flow of oil and push oil prices higher but it was iraqi oil that had slowed today
there are very few tankers loading iraqi oil at yumurtalik a senior turkish government official said referring to the export jetties on the turkish side of the mediterranean sea
in baghdad president saddam hussein ordered drills for millions of people in case mass evacuations were needed
he warned his nations  million people to be on alert for possible us or israeli attacks
the united states has warned iraq against any attack on saudi arabia and president bush has said all options are open for the united states
hundreds of kuwaitis took to the desert to flee into saudi arabia their children and a few belongings crammed into fourwheeldrive vehicles

illa wobig saw eight people just like him die on her street
what they all had in common was a little white shack on the west side of the berlin wall a guardhouse with a funny name that stood as a chilling symbol of the tensions that divided a street a city a nation the world
checkpoint charlie the famed allied border crossing on the west side of the berlin wall was lifted into the sky by a giant crane friday placed gently onto a flatbed truck and consigned to history
it was emptied locked and taken away in an elaborate ceremony attended by six foreign ministers a brace of generals a brass brand and hundreds of reporters
sir dismiss your detachment
french maj gen francois lann barked to a young american officer who crisply led away the last contingent of military police
the public was not invited to the ceremony on friedrich street the avenue blocked by checkpoint charlie and its oncefeared east german counterpart nearby
illa wobig raised six children in a fourthfloor apartment just  yards from checkpoint charlie
they saw it from their window for  years and they saw it disappear friday
i saw eight people shot to death on that street said mrs wobig 
i saw an east german officer try to go under a guard rail
he was shot in the neck
she said she saw at least  successful escapes
some were in cars and some came through a tunnel across the street she said
some would walk very slowly look around and just run
she is not sure if one of the people she saw was andreas bratke a yearold east berlin construction worker
tunnels balloons customized vehicles and other elaborate methods were used to flee past the berlin wall by desperate east germans
bratke just ran
i ran as fast as i could he said
i still cannot believe it
bratke is now a west berlin engineering student
he was taking his certification examinations this week
eight months after bratke made his bold escape sgt
patrick gainey was coming back from a party when he saw a huge commotion near checkpoint charlie
this guy had driven a cement truck with his girlfriend and baby through the checkpoint said gainey a us army photographer

the escapee was hansjoachim pofahl who made the crossing through a hail of bullets

i saw kennedy reagan and carter give speeches here she said
i saw a james bond movie filmed here
this is wonderful for history but it is sad for me
it was part of my home
former president reagan thanked british prime minister margaret thatcher for backing him up when other allies backed down heaping praise on his political soulmate as she heads off into the sunset
margaret thatcher was a completely reliable ally and partner of the greatest personal integrity reagan said in a statement after mrs thatcher announced her impending retirement
i could always count on her wise counsel her firm support and her loyal friendship reagan said
mrs thatcher on thursday succumbed to the challenge mounted by michael heseltine who resigned as her defense minister in 
reagan and the prime minister dubbed the iron lady formed a formidable duo in the s and made no secret of their mutual regard
they often stood sidebyside at international gatherings and called each other ronnie and margaret
two years ago as they met for the final time before reagan left office the president said he was leaving the white house with considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher will still reside at no
 downing street
reagan who spent thanksgiving with friends at his belair home called her resignation in the face of strong opposition a selfless and courageous decision in what she believes is the best interests of her country
the former chief executive was always grateful to mrs thatchers support of his conservative approach to foreign affairs during his own eightyear tenure
in  when the us bombing of libya was criticized by world powers mrs thatcher was the only ally who supported reagan and allowed the bombers to fly from british bases
when britain fought argentina for the falkland islands the united states was forced to choose between two allies
reagan sided with mrs thatcher
she also encouraged reagans nurturing of the huge pentagon buildup and backed us efforts to install mediumrange missiles in europe despite opposition from nato allies
both leaders adopted a hard line toward the soviet union but were quick to warm up to soviet president mikhail s gorbachev as the cold war thawed
reagan credited mrs thatchers resoluteness for playing a key role in ending the tensions between the western democracies and the eastern block
she stood up to the soviets and let them know she meant business he said
both were ardent advocates of the free market and private enterprise
while the united states became mired in debt in the era of reaganomics the british economy thrived on mrs thatchers radical policies during her nearly year rule
average earnings were up by nearly onethird and more britons owned their homes during her tenor
like reagan however mrs thatcher was accused by liberals of widening the gap between the rich and poor in her country and both clashed with organized labor

the chinese government says that  soldiers thugs bystanders and students have been killed during the martial law occupation of beijing
but most other estimates of casualties are far higher
state council spokesman yuan mu said on tuesday that  people including  soldiers have been injured and  other soldiers are missing and may be dead or wounded
nonofficial sources say yuans figures on civilian casualties are far too low but most have different estimates on the number of victims
they range from  to  people slain
in washington us intelligence reports indicate  people probably were killed according to a us official who spoke on condition of anonymity
he said estimates of the number of dead could go higher
nearly all of the deaths and injuries occurred saturday night and early sunday when troops firing randomly into large crowds smashed through barricades to reach tiananmen square and attack demonstrators demanding democratic reforms

but students who had joined the tiananmen occupation said hundreds of colleagues from the academy of fine arts who were huddled around their goddess of democracy statue in the square were shot or crushed by tanks
beijing university students said  of their fellow students who were in the square are missing

yuans statement said only  of the  people fatally injured were students
the exact number of people killed may never be known
victims were taken to dozens of hospitals clinics and homes and there is no indication the government will reveal many details of the tragedy
and the death toll mounts

the united states whose persian gulf naval patrols helped iraq defeat iran in the  war has six warships in the area
they have been conducting exercises since july  with forces of the united arab emirates some  miles southest of kuwait
iraq had moved about  troops to its border with kuwait after claiming that kuwaits production of oil beyond quotas of the opec cartel had depressed the world price thus diminishing iraqs revenue and that kuwait had been stealing oil from a field that straddles the border
iraqi officials on wednesday walked out on talks in jiddah saudia arabia aimed at resolving the weekold crisis with neighboring kuwait and complained that kuwait was not negotiating seriously
iraq threatened to invade once before in  after britain ended its protectorate over kuwait
iraq then claimed kuwait as part of its territory but the appearance on the kuwaiti side of the border of troops from britain and other arab states deterred further action by iraq
an emergency arab league council failed to publicly condemn iraqs invasion of kuwait on thursday and adjourned its meeting for  hours as arab leaders held urgent consultations on how to handle the crisis
kuwaits cabinet affairs minister abdelrahman elawadi told reporters he asked the nation arab league to condemn the attack
he accused iraq of using the laws of the jungle

at thursdays closed session hamadi reiterated iraqs claim its forces entered kuwait at the request of a kuwaiti revolutionary group that had overthrown the government
a conference source said several arab foreign ministers replied that they considered this to be an iraqi invasion which is against all united nations and arab league conventions
so far only lebanons prime minister and foreign minister salim hoss has joined kuwait in cairo in publicly condemning the invasion  the first time in modern history one arab country invaded another to take control of the government
hoss told reporters we do not see any justification for what happened whatever the arguments and pretexts

arab leaders must take the initiative and stop this bloodshed and return things to their normal situation
we also call on iraq to withdraw its troops

queen elizabeth ii awarded former prime minister margaret thatcher the coveted order of merit on friday and made her husband a baronet which is a hereditary knighthood
from now on denis thatcher will be formally addressed as sir denis and his wife as lady thatcher although she insisted friday she wished to be known simply as mrs
thatcher
i have done pretty well out of being mrs thatcher said the former prime minister who resigned nov  during a fight for the leadership of the conservative party
palace insiders said friday that one reason for the quick award of the order of merit restricted to only  eminent men and women was the queens desire to demonstrate that there is no animosity between britains two most prominent women
in the past buckingham palace sources and journalists assigned to the royal court have said that the two did not get along
this puts to rest rumors that the queen and mrs thatcher didnt like each other said harold brooksbaker director of burkes peerage and an authority on the royal family
as a member of the order of merit created in  thatcher joins such luminaries in the world of arts science and politics as philosopher isiah berlin historian veronica wedgwood writer graham greene violinist yehudi menuhin and artist sidney noland as well as honorary member mother teresa
deceased recipients include prime minister winston churchill gen dwight d eisenhower missionary albert schweitzer and actor lawrence olivier
contrary to some reports the om as it is popularly called does not precede all other british royal honors but ranks behind the order of the garter which dates from 
thatcher said she was deeply honored and moved by the award
at the same time the queen gave a baronetcy to thatchers husband denis the subject of fictional letters from no
 downing street invented by the satirical magazine private eye about life as the prime ministers consort
baronets date from 
sir denis title passes upon his death to his son mark who is married to an american and will eventually pass to mark thatchers son michael
with an om thatcher can continue to serve in the house of commons as the member from the north london constituency of finchley
burkes brooksbaker believes that thatcher eventually should be made a hereditary countess which in britain is the female equivalent of an earl
traditionally retiring prime ministers of britain were granted earldoms although churchill for one refused a peerage preferring to remain in the house of commons
in addition to the leonard bernstein tribute that is part of the los angeles philharmonic program this weekend other local orchestras are also planning special remembrances
sunday at royce hall the american youth symphony has added local composer leon levitchs elegy for strings  a personal choice from conductor mehli mehta  to the program to honor bernstein who died last sunday

kkgofm  also devoted a considerable amount air time to bernsteins work on tuesday and wednesday
another measure of grief came from the obituary section of the new york times which includes a section of special classified ads for public condolences at  a line
the outpouring of emotions following bernsteins death filled almost  lines  inches of small type and encompassed  separate tributes
among the contributors were conductors zubin mehta and kurt masur as well as peter martins of the new york ballet and christopher keene of the new york city opera
leonard bernstein 
is now being mourned by the entire world
i personally have lost a dear friend
wrote mehta in his tribute
i was proud to be associated with him at the new york philharmonic and the israel philharmonic orchestra both of which he considered family
this is perhaps not unusual for a prominent member of the jewish community involved with philanthropic activities reported irv horowitz the new york times obituary editor
he said the biggest similar reaction he could recall came after the recent death of the mother of the new york times publisher
that was considerably larger horowitz said

mr michael stoney a senior executive in a number of maxwell companies is named as one of three people primarily responsible for more than pounds m of unusual payments from mirror group newspapers bank accounts during the last financial year according to the chairmans statement released with mgn accounts yesterday
mr kevin maxwell and mr ian maxwell two sons of the late robert maxwell are named as the other two people most involved in these transactions
mr kevin maxwell and mr stoney refused to provide mgn with information the statement says
sir robert clark chairman of mgn lists a series of transactions  some of which he stresses may have been perfectly legitimate  that took place in the past few months
he says legal action may be taken against a number of organisations including goldman sachs the us investment bank over more than pounds m in transfers from mgn if the bank was aware that they were effected for improper purposes
notes to the accounts show that mgn made extraordinary provisions of pounds m in the year to december   including pounds m in pension deficiencies and pounds m in transactions with maxwellcontrolled companies
sir robert says that during the year there were at least  unusual payments for more than pounds m from the groups bank accounts making a total of more than pounds m
some may well ultimately be established to have arisen under legitimate transactions
nine of the payments were authorised solely by robert maxwell
the others were authorised mainly by mr kevin maxwell mr ian maxwell and mr michael stoney he says
one transfer to goldman sachs was countersigned by mr ernest burrington former managing director at the request of mr kevin maxwell on the reported instruction of robert maxwell
two authorisations were countersigned by mr lawrence guest former mgn finance director
sir robert says the mgn directors do not believe that either mr burrington or mr guest knew there was anything improper about these payments
with these exceptions the independent directors 
were not involved in and did not authorise or approve any of these payments he says
sir robert says the group finance department accepted assurances from the treasury department  which was headed by mr stoney  about the nature of certain transactions including payments to financial institutions which were recorded as deposits
the treasury department arranged for it to appear that sums of interest had been credited to the group in respect of those deposits he says
in his report sir robert points to certain weaknesses accepted by the mgn board internal controls and operating procedures which failed to identify related party transactions and bring them to the attention of independent directors for approval bank mandates authorised by robert maxwell and mr stoney which permitted the movement of group funds on the authority of maxwell or directors who were also directors of maxwellcontrolled companies the audit committee of nonexecutive directors which might have reviewed systems and mandates but was not convened the finance departments inadequate authority to verify and record the treasury departments activities
the report details a pounds m loan made by bankers trust in london last october which appears to have been used to pay off a loan from bankers trust in new york to robert maxwell group parent of the maxwell private interests separately the statement highlights three transfers of more than pounds m from mgn to goldman sachs  pounds m of this was transferred on robert maxwells signature to pay for previous dealings in maxwell communication corporation stock
the balance was for foreign exchange trade exposures incurred by bishopsgate investment trust and robert maxwell group it says
he says mgn is inquiring to see whether it can establish if goldman sachs was aware or should have been aware that the transfers had been effected for improper purposes
if so he says it will be possible to seek orders against them 
for the sums paid
he says mgn is considering legal action against professional advisers in relation to property leases and hopes to recover money through claims on insurance policies written on robert maxwells life

the bodies of  sailors killed in the gun explosion on the iowa arrived in the united states on thursday as the navy tried to figure out what caused the battleships turret to blow up
none of the guns in the no
 turret had been fired before the explosion instantly killed the seamen navy officials said
they discarded a theory that the blast had been sparked by redhot debris left in the guns breech by earlier rounds
the navy organized a board of inquiry and placed a moratorium on firing inch guns found only on the iowa and its three sister battleships the new jersey the wisconsin and the missouri
the iowa was headed back to its home port at norfolk va while the bodies of the dead were flown to the military mortuary at dover air force base in delaware and families of the battleships  crewmen waited to learn whether their relatives were among the dead
at the white house chief of staff john sununu announced president bush will attend a memorial service monday for the victims in norfolk
he said the president had heard of the service and told his staff if it could be fitted in he wanted to be there  wants to be a part
the blast occurred wednesday morning northeast of puerto rico as the iowa took part in firing exercises that were part of naval training
a spokesman for the atlantic fleet and the ships former captain both said the explosion in the no
 turret could have been triggered by redhot debris from earlier firings in the threegun turret
but cmdr
mark baker chief of the navys pentagon press office said later that none of the turrets three guns had been fired
only four rounds of  scheduled to be fired as part of a training exercise had been fired he said and all had been from the no
 turret forward of the one that exploded
no eyewitnesses survived wednesdays explosion behind one of the inch guns on the iowa one of the largest warships ever
pentagon officials declined to speculate publicly about the exact cause of the disaster the worst to strike a navy ship since  but two officers  capt
paul hanley a fleet spokesman and capt
larry seaquist the ships former captain  said a possible explanation was that redhot debris from a previous round ignited new charges
but seaquist stressed we simply do not know what caused that powder to go
baker said no guns in the no
 turret had been fired and the order had just been given to the no
 turret crew to load and prepare the center gun when the explosion occurred
we have no eyewitnesses to what actually transpired defense secretary dick cheney told reporters as he headed back to washington from a nato meeting in brussels
the iowa sailed to roosevelt roads navy base in puerto rico to unload the bodies which were then flown to delaware
navy investigators boarded the ship as it left for norfolk where it is expected to arrive sunday or monday
navy secretary william ball attended a memorial service at the delaware base home of the armed services largest mortuary
the flagdraped coffins were carried off a plane by navy honor guards
around the united states navy officers and chaplains broke the bad news to the dead mens next of kin
the job began just before midnight wednesday when officials in norfolk received the list of the dead
ive done it many times and ill never get used to it said cmdr
doug palmer acting chaplain for the norfolk navy base
five men had families in the norfolk area
the commander of the us nd fleet adm jerome johnson who was on board the iowa told reporters in puerto rico the fire and explosion was instantaneous
cheney indicated the casualties were all in the swiveling gun house at the top of the turret rather than the mechanical compartments and ammunition magazines below it
eleven men escaped from powder magazines deep within the ship at the base of the turret
a dozen crew members suffered minor injuries fighting the fire caused by the explosion
they were treated and returned to duty said pentagon spokesman fred hoffman
at the white house president bush brushed aside suggestions that the explosion was due to the age of the iowa a world war ii leviathan brought out of mothballs during the military buildup of the reagan administration
asked about the ships safety bush said he wanted to insure that procedures were checked to be sure that safety is at the highest point  but i wouldnt jump to the conclusion that because that kind of powder was put into these turrets in that way that makes a useful platform obsolete
adm richard d milligan a former commander of the new jersey began the board of inquirys investigation
hoffman said he could not predict when the investigation would be completed
seaquist told reporters it seems from the reports that those powders exploded
he referred to the six pound sacks of powder rammed into each gun after it is loaded with a pound shell
seaquist said a pressurized air system that clears debris from the breech at a guns rear must be operated manually
each gun has a oneinch diameter tube carrying air under  pounds of pressure to blow debris from the foot barrel
the only officer killed was lt jg
phillip edward buch from las cruces nm who would normally be in a small compartment at the rear of the swivelling top of the turret adjacent to the room in which shells are loaded
naval officers familiar with the iowa said an explosion can occur if a gun breech is cracked or from a shell that cooks off  ignites prematurely from the heat of the barrel or smoldering debris left in the barrel from the previous round
the first thing that comes to mind is something like a cookoff said hanley
it could have been a bag or a projectile
we just dont know yet
none of the four battleships of the iowa class which saw service in world war ii and the korean and vietnam wars has ever sustained such an explosion pentagon officials said
wednesdays explosion brought the worst loss of life for the navy since a  accident off spain in which  sailors died when a launch returning them to the uss guam and the uss trenton was struck by a spanish freighter
except for two world war ii japanese battleships and the current navy aircraft carriers the ton ships of the iowa class are the largest warships in the world

for the new york philharmonic it was supposed to be a night of beethoven and shostakovich
the fates made it a night of leonard bernstein
the official catalog of his works says bernstein led  orchestras
but this was his orchestra and the musicians came to pay tribute to their laureate conductor who led them through  concerts during his year association with the philharmonic
they let his music do the talking
tonights concert is not an evening in which we want to dwell on the passing of a giant but rather what he has left us guest conductor leonard slatkin told the audience at avery fisher hall on thursday night
so four nights after bernsteins death at age  beethovens violin concerto became bernsteins serenade for solo violin string orchestra harp and percussion  shostakovichs symphony no
 became bernsteins symphony no
 jeremiah written in 
also added were his chichester psalms  and his overture to candide 
the substitute bernstein program was being repeated friday night saturday and tuesday
it was an extraordinary concert
there werent many smiling faces among the audience or musicians
slatkins brief introductory comments followed by the whimsical candide broke some of the tension
then came the eclectic serenade which bernsteins program notes says is supposed to be based on platos symposium
it begins with a lyrical praise of the eros the god of love
the piece is sometimes jocular sometimes melancholy sometimes assaulting and sometimes hedonistic
it ends in drunken revelry an intrusion of jazz  as if bernstein was looking down from heaven and telling the audience its ok
to smile tonight
the soloist  concertmaster glenn dicterow  played with much agility especially through the difficult double stops and especially considering the lack of preparation time
the mourning returned after intermission but not without optimism
jeremiah begins with suspenseful strings followed by a cantorial french horn a melodic return to the strings and then a prophetic blaring of brass
the second movement continues the pointcounterpoint of brass versus strings jeremiah versus the corrupt priests with nebuchadnezzar looming on the horizon
in the third movement jerusalem has fallen to the babylonian king
judea is exiled
jeremiah weeps
how she sits desolate  the city once so full of people  she is become as a widow
during her chanting of the prophets lamentations mezzosoprano wendy white had to wipe a tear from her eye
s did members of the audience
last on the program was another hebraic elegy chichester psalms
the new york choral artists and a boy soloist joined the orchestra
two harpists dominated the center of the crowded stage
awake psaltery and harp
the choir begins in hebrew
i will rouse the dawn
in the second movement an angelic thgrader evan weber sings king davids rd psalm the lord is my shepherd i shall not want
after he finishes the mens chorus bellows why do the nations rage
the piece however ends in a mahlerian motif and chorus declaring a message bernstein had sought for society behold how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity
to emphasize the point after the final note slatkin suspended his hands for several long moments of silence
then came the cascade of applause
for leonard bernstein
bfn dushanbe  may tass  the tajik communist party has called for the restoration of a renovated soviet union in the form of a federation as the only means to ensure the development of the political economic and spiritual potential of former soviet republics
tajik communists leader shodiy shabdolov told itartass on monday  maythat the disintegration of the soviet union and the parade of sovereignty that followed it have led to economic and political chaos in all republics
radical market reforms imposed by quasi democrats and wild privatisation have enriched a small group of nouveau riches and plunged the rest of the population in poverty and hunger he said
the mass drive for sovereignty was accompanied by armed interethnic conflicts in many exsoviet republics and outburst of nationalism
tajikistan was hit most hard
the civil war in the republic claimed the lives of more than  people shabdolov said
he noted that the majority of the population support tajik communists call for the restoration of the soviet union
over one million people about twothirds of the adult population signed appeals for unity brotherhood and friendship of the peoples of the ussr adopted by numerous conferences and meetings held all across the republic
supporters of the restoration of a renovated union held a founding congress of their movement in dushanbe on saturday
apart from the communist party the founders of the new movement include tajik trade unions the union of tajik women organisations of veterans and ethnic and cultural associations
we are confident that our movement is growing so strong that it cannot be stopped shabdolov said
he stressed that it will act within the framework of the law and use only constitutional methods
we are against barricades and use of force he said
if thats so said sen paul simon dill hes the only person gathered in the room who does not have an opinion
 sen herb kohl dwis added im concerned about his candor his willingness to be forthcoming
kohl was todays leadoff questioner as the hearings entered their third day
 two pivotal members of the member committee  howell heflin dala and arlen specter rpa  also voiced concern about thomas answers
but the panels traditional third swing vote dennis deconcini dariz said thomas was doing well
 heflin cited the appearance of a confirmation conversion and said it may raise questions of thomas integrity and temperament
 but heflin added i am not at this time of any firm opinion one way or the other on whether thomas should be confirmed
 and simon said thomas performance thus far has neither helped him nor hurt him
 specter blamed fellow committee members more than thomas in concluding we really havent moved very far in the process
 thomas a black federal appeals judge was picked by president bush to replace the retiring thurgood marshall the high courts only black justice
 deconcini said he thought the conservative thomas handled the privacy questions very well without taking a stand on abortion
i dont see how you could ask him to do anything more
 thomas expanded earlier testimony by saying wednesday that he believed the right of marital privacy was fundamental  a status that accords it the fullest judicial protection from government intrusion
 but he repeatedly refused to state his views on the  abortion decision based on womens right of privacy
to give such an answer he said would undermine my ability to sit in an impartial way on such an important case
 thomas who sat alone at the witness table with no notes or reference materials also claimed a lack of familiarity with the subject matter when asked about some of his former speeches and articles
 that moved committee chairman joseph biden ddel to give thomas a stack of the judges past speeches so the nominee could help me understand them during future questioning
 thomas testifying calmly but warily did offer fuller comment on another hot issue before the high court prayer in public schools
 after simon discussed the feelings decades ago of a jewish elementary schoolboy who left the room each day while his classmates recited a prayer thomas said any policy of exclusion should be considered inappropriate
 outside the hearing room abortionrights advocates said thomas should not be allowed to disavow past comments they say show he would vote to ban most if not all abortions
 his most unimpressive testimony poses two equally disturbing possibilities he is either willfully misleading the committee about his views to win confirmation or he is a man whose convictions have shallow roots said arthur kropp of people for the american way
 sen patrick leahy dvt said he could not understand how thomas prior statements touching on the  abortion decision could have been made without considering its content
im not satisfied with the answers leahy said
 although thomas appeared to back away from comments made in past speeches or articles he told the committee my view is that i have been consistent
 thomas opponents believe republicans strom thurmond of south carolina orrin hatch of utah charles grassley of iowa alan simpson of wyoming and hank brown of colorado are solid thomas backers
 but they hope sens
edward m kennedy dmass and howard metzenbaum dohio will be joined by the three swingvote senators and biden leahy simon and kohl in voting against the nominee
 biden and kennedy declined comment wednesday on their leanings
 metzenbaum said thomas refusal to give direct answers makes it more difficult to vote for him
 thomas views excerpts from clarence thomas testimony on abortion i have no reason or agenda to prejudge the issue 
or a predilection to rule one way or another on the issue of abortion
 on affirmative action the line that i drew was a line that said that we shouldnt have preferences or goals or timetables or quotas
 on natural law at no time did i feel nor do i feel now that natural law is anything more than the background to our constitution
 hear it see it senate confirmation hearings for supreme court nominee clarence thomas are scheduled to run through friday this week and every weekday except wednesday next week

a local prosecutor immediately declared the strike illegal solidarity officials said
andrzej andrzejczak head of the morcinek mine strike committee said we support all of the demands of the july manifesto mine workers
the mine is about  miles south of july manifesto where strikers were demanding legalization of the outlawed independent labor federation pay raises and reinstatement of workers fired for trade union activites
police ringing july manifesto one of polands largest coal mines today turned away area residents who tried to bring food to the strikers
andrzejczak said the morcinek miners broke off talks with management when they were refused access to loudspeakers and contact with the strikers at july manifesto
he said miners erected a large polish flag atop the administration building and were blocking the complexs main entrance
it was not immediately known how many workers were involved
the second strike came as solidarity strike committee members met with management and representatives of the industry ministry at the july manifesto colliery
adam kowalczyk a regional solidarity leader said more workers were joining colleagues inside by leaping over police barricades
the strike committee issued a communique today saying the workers would not end their stoppage until their demands are met and charged the mine management is trying to end the strike by hunger
police surrounded the mine after workers put down their tools on tuesday
witnesses said about  officers were outside and about  strikers inside
the strikes mark the eighth anniversary of the birth of the solidarity which communist authorities crushed in a  military crackdown

seven years late the hubble space telescope is where it belongs out of this world and in search of others so distant that they may have been formed at the beginning of time
less than five hours after it rode into space aboard the shuttle discovery on tuesday the  billion telescope sent its first test radio signal
at the sign of life applause and cheers erupted in mission control in houston
as near as we can tell everything looks perfect said astronaut steve hawley from the shuttle
hawleys job on wednesday will be to drop the telescope overboard for a year stay in space
discovery trailing an arc of white smoke into a brilliant blue sky carried the silvercolored telescope to an orbit  miles above earth  higher by  miles than any previous shuttle
there the hubble will stay to search for yetunseen wonders of creation with instruments that can look  billion years backward in time
our window on the universe
nasa launch commentator george diller exulted as the discovery rose off its seaside launch pad
its a beautiful day to have hubble space telescope in orbit instead of here on earth like its been for so many years said nasa administrator richard truly
hubbles in its element and im delighted
the telescope was supposed to be launched in  but technical problems and the challenger accident delayed its deployment
it suffered a further delay two weeks ago when the countdown was stopped at the fourminutestogo point because of a faulty hydraulic unit on the shuttle
while it remained on earth the telescope cost  million a month to exercise and keep in readiness
in its first day in space that checkout and testing continued remotely under control of the goddard space flight center in maryland
on hand to watch the discovery launching was a contingent of scientists who have hailed the hubble as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
truly referred to the earlyday astronomer when he was asked about the long delays in getting the telescope to its working station
somebody the other day said who remembers the day that galileo picked up his telescope to look at the stars
said truly a former shuttle astronaut
it doesnt matter what day we launch hubble it matters that we do it right
the telescope is  feet long and  feet in diameter about the size of a railroad tank car
when it flies free it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays that extend outward on each side
it is named after the late astronomer edwin p hubble who theorized that the universe was expanding and that the farther away a galaxy is the faster it is traveling
that gave support to the theory that a massive explosion  the big bang  created the universe  to  billion years ago
the hubble is expected to help provide the answer to two major questions how old is the universe
how big is it
the telescope has two mirrors one  inches in diameter the other  inches
two of the instruments are cameras two are spectrometers and one is a photometer
in addition the fine pointing system acts as a sixth instrument by providing precise measurement of distances
on wednesday hawley is to grapple the ton telescope with the shuttles mechanical arm lift it out of the cargo bay point it and  after a long checkout  drop it overboard to orbit on its own
in the cargo bay the telescope receives electrical power from the shuttle
but the juice is cut when the instrument is lifted out and it will depend on internal batteries until the solar panels are extended to receive light from the sun
should the solar panels not deploy mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan will be standing by partially dressed in space suits ready to go into the open cargo bay to unfurl the arrays manually
discoverys launch was not without its problems
with  seconds left in the countdown the computer that runs the final moments before liftoff refused to close a fuel valve and stopped the launch process
the problem was overcome and the shuttle lifted off at  am edt about three minutes late
the shuttle is scheduled to land sunday at  am edt at edwards air force base in california
on the way uphill as commander loren j shriver put it the shuttles windshield was splattered with several flecks of things
he said the windshield was streaked by the debris and that it also was smeared when the spent booster rockets fell off during the climb to orbit
the astronauts also had problems with their uhf radio circuit and one of the ships small rear thrusters was inoperative
neither problem was considered serious

an argentine supply ship that ran aground off antarctica sank tuesday in heavy seas and high winds the government said and there was concern oil in its hold could leak and damage the environment
the sinking of the foot bahia paraiso followed warnings from the us national science foundation that the unspoiled antarctic could face ecological disaster if the  gallons of diesel fuel aboard the ship were to spill
no injuries were reported in the sinking
tourists aboard and the crew had been evacuated from the vessel which was  miles south of cape horn the tip of south america
salvage efforts had been hampered by  mph winds
the doublehulled oceanographic ship sank at about  pm the government news agency telam said citing a navy communique
telam did not say whether the ship broke up or if diesel oil spilled when it went down
the depth of the water in which the ship sank was not immediately known
the ship had been carrying supplies including jet fuel gasoline and canisters of compressed gases to the argentine esperanza station near the tip of the antarctic peninsula the national science foundation said in a statement released in washington
the ship ran aground saturday about two miles from palmer station a us research facility on the antarctic peninsula the continents tip
it sustained a footlong gash in its hull and some of the  gallons of diesel fuel began leaking washing ashore near palmer station
the fuel killed some krill a tiny shrimplike creature that is a vital part of the antarctic food chain and has affected penguins sea gulls and giant petrel birds the national science foundation statement said
there were no immediate details about the extent of damage to the wildlife in the pristine surroundings
agency spokesman jack renerie said tuesday before the ship sank that the leak which was threatening penguins and other wildlife had stopped
scientists are concerned that some research search projects may already have been affected by the leak a foundation statement said
it said two argentine salvage vessels were expected to arrive thursday or friday
before the sinking argentine officials had discounted a spill
telam quoted argentine navy sources as saying the fuel it carried both for itself and the antarctic stations was in steel drums so a spill is practically impossible
the  people aboard the ship when it ran aground including  passengers and  crew members were rescued by power boats and taken to palmer station
the passengers and most of the crew were taken by cruise ship to the south shetland islands from which they were airlifted to the south american mainland sunday
but  crewmen remain at the station said renerie
because the station is equipped for only  people food has been rationed to two meals a day a national science foundation statement said
iraqs powerful army invaded this small oilrich kingdom early today
tankled troops quickly seized the rulers palace and government buildings and the emir fled to saudi arabia kuwaiti officials said
kuwaits us ambassador said the iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the countrys oil facilities
he appealed for us military intervention
a pentagon source said us navy ships were diverted to the region but president bush said the subject of intervention was not being discussed
the iraqis have occupied all of kuwait
a kuwaiti government official shouted in a telephone interview
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf estimated that more than  kuwaitis were killed or wounded
the iraqi government of president saddam hussein claimed it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free kuwait
kuwait and un diplomats labeled the coup report a farce
the assault followed two weeks of tension between kuwait and iraq caused by iraqi accusations that kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area
saddam also accused kuwait of exceeding opec production quotas thus driving down the price of oil a major iraqi revenue source
the attack had wideranging ramifications oil prices soared  a barrel in early trading because of fears the invasion would disrupt supplies
prices were about  higher later
president bush signed orders freezing iraqi assets in the united states and blocking most iraqi imports including oil
oil accounts for  percent of iraqi imports to the united states and makes up about  percent of us oil consumption
bush also froze kuwaiti assets to prevent iraq from seizing them
the soviet union iraqs main arms supplier halted weapons sales
the un security council voted  to denounce the invasion and demanded immediate withdrawal of iraqi troops
a pentagon source said the aircraft carrier uss independence escorted by a sixship battle group was diverted from the indian ocean toward the gulf where other us ships were already patrolling
secretary of state james a baker iii planned to fly to moscow to issue a rare joint statement friday with soviet foreign minister eduard a shevardnadze about the invasion
the plan which was announced in washington illustrates the dramatic improvement in relations between the superpowers who once routinely lined up on opposite sides of most regional disputes
kuwaits us ambassador sheik saud nasir alsabah told reporters in washington we are desperate for any help we can get
he appealed specifically for american intervention
in recent days diplomats said iraq had massed more than  troops at the border
kuwaits entire armed forces has  soldiers
bush said the united states would take whatever steps necessary to defend interests in the gulf
asked if this included military force bush said were not discussing intervention
but he said he would not discuss military options publicly
it was the first time in modern history an arab nation had invaded another and taken over its government
kuwaits army was no match for iraq battlehardened after eight years of war with iran
iraq has emerged as the arab worlds strongest and most militant military power and saddam has a vast arsenal of chemical and conventional weapons
diplomats said about  iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after crossing the border  miles away at dawn
witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious
the invaders surrounded the palace of kuwaits ruler sheik jaber alahmed alsabah
residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy artillery barrages
diplomats said sheik fahd alahmed alsabah one of the emirs brothers was killed while trying to defend the palace
there were about  tanks around the palace and the neighboring american embassy residents said
the alsabah family has ruled the citystate for almost  years
the kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in saudi arabia
operating from an unknown location alahmeds government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating kuwait is kuwait to its people let by the emir sheik jaber and his crown prince sheik saad
god preserve them from all harm
for its part the provisional government announced through baghdads official iraqi news agency that it was dissolving parliament and would hold free and honest elections at a future date
the iraqi forces were led by the elite republican guard which did the brunt of fighting in the iraniraq war
troops set up roadblocks at major intersections and shot at cars that did not stop
baghdad television said iraq qould withdraw its forces within days or weeks depending on how quickly the situation stabilized
kuwaits land and sea borders were closed as was the airport
diplomats said the invasion was too swift to arrange the evacuation of nationals and foreigners were asked to keep a low profile
there are about  americans among the large expatriate community in kuwait where more than  percent of the  million residents are foreigners
us officials monitoring the situation had no reports of harm to us citizens in iraq white house spokesman roman popadiuk said
foreigners reached by telephone said they watched from their windows or dived for cover as the invasion began
we were totally unprepared said catherine baker of illinois
one feels like there should have been a bit of warning
the british embassy was hit by shellfire and the sheraton and hilton hotels evacuated their clientele the diplomats said
the invasion came hours after iraq broke off talks intended to mend its differences with kuwait
iraqi first threatened military action against its former ally kuwait two weeks ago
washington declared its support for kuwait from the start
during the iraniraq war american ships protected usflagged kuwaiti tankers from attacks in the gulf

doctors should be cautious in prescribing aspirin as a preventer of heart attacks until more research supports its value the food and drug administration said
taking aspirin to prevent heart attacks may increase some peoples chances of dying of other things especially hemorrhagic strokes the agency said in a commentary in todays journal of the american medical association
the fda persuaded aspirin makers in march to refrain from promoting aspirin as a preventer of first heart attacks at least for now
a study published in january indicated an aspirin every other day reduced the risk of nonfatal first heart attacks  in  male doctors over five years compared with  who took a nonaspirin substitute
aspirin tends to promote bleeding by reducing the ability of blood platelets to help form clots
heart attacks usually occur when clots form in the arteries nourishing the heart and choke off its blood supply
but aspirin may increase health risks for people who already have clotting problems or for those who have high blood pressure which puts them at increased risk for hemorrhagic strokes the fda commentary said
strokes are the result of brain damage caused by bleeding in the brain or by blood clots hemorrhagic strokes are those caused by bleeding
the fda commentary pointed to  hemorrhagic strokes recorded among the  subjects taking aspirin in the recent study compared with two such strokes among  subjects taking the substitute
overall death rates for the two groups were the same though the aspirin groups nonfatal heartattack rate was much lower
there were  nonfatal heart attacks among the aspirin users and  in the comparison group
physicians will for a time be forced to make their professional judgments about aspirin use on the basis of incomplete information said the fda commentary cowritten by agency director dr frank e young
we agree with them completely said dr julie buring a harvard university researcher who participated in the aspirin study
she added in a telephone interview yesterday that an extension of the study is under way and researchers expect to report to the fda in late fall
the commentary noted a british study also released in january of  male physicians that found that aspirin failed to protect against heart attacks and that it was associated with a  fold increase in disabling strokes

an intestinal operation to lower the cholesterol of heart attack patients reduced their risk for another heart attack or death from heart disease researchers said today
the surgery called a partial ileal bypass has one significant drawback it causes chronic diarrhea that persists for years
in the operation doctors change the route of the small intestine so about onethird of it is bypassed
this reduces the amount of cholesterol that is absorbed into the bloodstream
the  million year study was conducted on people who had already suffered heart attacks
the approach lengthened the lives of people who had very mild heart attacks but not those with more severe heart damage
during an average of  years of follow up the death rate among surgery patients who had sustained minimal heart damage was  percent
in a comparison group without the intestinal surgery it was  percent
dr henry buchwald of the university of minnesota who directed the study said the surgery should be considered along with cholesterollowering drugs as a possible standard treatment
it has a role in the management of patients with high cholesterol who have had a heart attack buchwald said
it is eminently logical to extend all cholesterollowering therapy including this to patients with high cholesterol who have not had a heart attack
besides diarrhea those who undergo the surgery are somewhat more prone to have kidney stones gallstones and intestinal obstructions
the study was conducted in minneapolis los angeles philadelphia and little rock ark and published in todays new england journal of medicine
despite wide acceptance of cholesterol lowering doubts remain about whether it actually helps people live longer if they already have healthy hearts
although the latest study was conducted exclusively on people who had suffered heart attacks buchwald said he believes the research should settle that question
it offers the strongest justification for marked lipid cholesterol ineervention that has ever been offered buchwald said
it is a very powerful study and should except for certain people who will never be satisfied end the cholesterol controversy
in the study  people who recovered from heart attacks underwent the surgery while a comparison group of  people were treated with diet alone
at the start of the study their average cholesterol levels were 
the surgery lowered peoples cholesterol  percent
the overall risk of dying from heart disease or suffering another nonfatal heart attack was reduced  percent among the surgical patients with the healthiest hearts
the surgical patients also required less than half as many coronary bypass operations because of clogged heart arteries
prime minister margaret thatcher has weakened her position and kicked off the race to succeed her by saying she plans to step down after winning another term opposition leaders and political observers said
a prothatcher newspaper today said she had merely stated the obvious and that her statements were no cause for astonishment
mrs thatcher told the sunday correspondent in an interview published sunday that she hoped to lead her conservative party to a fourth successive election but said it was unlikely she would try for a fifth
i think people would think it was time for someone else to carry the torch she told the newspaper
the sunday times of london said in a commentary mrs thatcher has committed a colossal blunder
she has given the riders for the tory succession their starting orders years in advance of the actual race the newspaper said
the next election must be held by the summer of  but it is expected mrs thatcher will call it in 
mrs thatcher who turned  last month has never previously made it clear in public when she plans to retire as party leader
she was elected in  the first female prime minister in europe and won reelection in  and in  when she said she planned to go on and on
earlier this year mrs thatcher overtook liberal lord asquiths  tenure as prime minister to become britains longest continuously serving prime minister of the th century
mrs thatchers popularity is the lowest of any prime minister since opinion polls began in britain  years ago and senior colleagues have publicly admonished her to change her leadership style following the surprise resignation of her treasury chief nigel lawson
lord callaghan former labor prime minister whom mrs thatcher defeated in  said her comments had considerably weakened her position
if her party wins the next election it is expected mrs thatcher would step down before her term ends to allow her successor to choose a time to call a new election
my guess is that the tory party will want someone as leader who could take them through the next parliament callaghan said
if mrs thatcher resigns while in office her successor elected by the party automatically becomes prime minister with approval of queen elizabeth ii but convention dictates that he or she seek a mandate in a general election as soon as possible
the sunday times speculated she would step down by 
mrs thatcher would celebrate her th birthday that year and her husband denis will be  and his age may have been a factor in her decision the newspaper said
the newspaper predicted the opposition labor party will try to promote leader neil kinnock as the occupantinwaiting of  downing st who is ready able and willing to complete a full term
kinnock called mrs thatchers comments the interview of someone preparing herself for quitting
mentally margaret thatcher is preparing herself for packing her bags
in an editorial today the prothatcher daily telegraph said mrs thatcher was merely stating the obvious by indicating she would not seek a fifth term
even were she not to fight a fifth election mrs thatcher could yet enjoy seven more years in charge it said
by then she would be in her s and her devoted husband a decade older 
nonetheless what other politician would be expected to entertain an inquiry about his or her intentions in seven years time
and can it really be a cause for astonishment that mrs thatcher is unwilling to commit herself to political activity in her mids and beyond

lucille ball the leggy showgirl model and bgrade movie queen whose pumpkin hair and genius for comedy made her an icon of television died early wednesday a week after undergoing emergency heart surgery
the cocreator and star of i love lucy a product of tvs golden age that continues via syndication to be viewed by millions around the world was  and died at cedarssinai medical center of a ruptured abdominal aorta
known simply as lucy to four decades of smitten television fans she had undergone surgery at cedarssinai on april  to replace part of her aorta and aortic valve and had recovered from the  hour operation to a point where she was eating and even walking around her hospital room
hospital spokesman ronald wise said the rupture occurred in a portion of the aorta the main heart artery far from where the operation was performed
she suffered a complete heart failure at  am and  minutes of resuscitation efforts proved fruitless wise said
there was nothing to indicate this would happen wise said
the heart itself apparently was not involved in miss balls sudden death
since last weeks surgery fans had flooded the hospital with thousands of getwell cards sent via telegram and even facsimile machine
hospital officials said it was the largest outpouring they had ever seen
miss ball was a toughtalking woman who had used her stardom and show business savvy to become with her thenhusband the late desi arnaz head of one of hollywoods major studios desilu
despite her business acumen she remained the unquestioned queen of television comedy
from her starstruck childhood through her struggles as a wisecracking movie actress in the s and s to the television career that made her a legend miss balls life was in the best show business tradition of rags to riches
almost humbly she liked to say she owed her enormous success not so much to talent but to a magical combination of guts and good supporting players
her greatest achievements she always would add were not any milestones in her career but ranked somewhere under the birth of her two children lucie in  and desi jr two years later
i am not funny ball told an interviewer for rolling stone magazine in 
my writers were funny
my directors were funny
the situations were funny
what i am is brave
i have never been scared
not when i did movies certainly not when i was a model and not when i did i love lucy
it was i love lucy which premiered on cbs on oct   that earned miss ball her niche in television history
the minute comedy starred miss ball and the cubanborn arnaz as the wacky lucy ricardo and her congaplaying husband ricky
the show was a weekly dash into absurdity that boasted the biggest television audience of its time  of almost any time
stopped the nation in creating the show miss ball and arnaz  who died in   set a pattern of television that was to be repeated in decades to come
they filmed the programs in front of a live audience and in doing so invented the popular and financially rewarding rerun
the show was so popular during the s that it literally stopped the nation every monday night from  pm to  pm
in fact nighttime shoppers became so scarce in chicago that the mammoth marshall field department store posted a sign that read we love lucy too so from now on we will be open thursday night instead of monday
when presidential candidate adlai e stevenson interrupted the show once for a political message he was flooded with angry mail
even a charge that miss ball was a communist made by the house unamerican activities committee in  failed to dent her popularity
the charges based on her registering to vote as a communist in  were dropped when miss ball explained she had done so only to please her ailing grandfather
millions of sympathetic fans and a pragmatic cbs understood
a phenomenal  million viewers watched the antics each week as lucy would always try to outwit ricky
with their best friends and landlords fred and ethel mertz played by veterans william frawley and vivian vance as the perfect foils the ricardos found themselves mired in situations that frequently were rowdy and always ridiculous
a generation of americans grew to recap their favorite lucy episodes plot twist by crazy twist
there was the time lucy schemed her way onto rickys television show to do a commercial for a vegetable drink with a high alcoholic content and got hilariously tipsy during the many retakes
then there was the time she threw in two packages of yeast while baking homemade bread and ended up pinned against the wall of her manhattan kitchen by a monster loaf
and there was the time lucy and ethel trying to impress their new york friends with the ultimate souvenir from a trip to hollywood pried loose the cement block containing john waynes footprints from in front of graumans chinese theater
of course the block broke
week after week lucy would find herself trapped in a vat of laundry starch locked in a meat freezer or lost on a subway with a loving cup stuck on her head
her turmoils permanently positioned her in the hearts of most americans including the critics
an extraordinary discipline and intuitive understanding of farce give i love lucy an engaging lilt wrote new york times critic jack gould
in its lucy cover story time magazine said this is the sort of cheerful rowdiness that has been rare
lucille submits enthusiastically to being hit with pies falls over furniture
tricked out as a ballerina or a hindu maharani or a toothless hillbilly she takes her assorted lumps and pratfalls with unflagging zest and good humor
in a  interview in the times even miss ball admitted i love lucy
there were two key qualities to her the comedienne said
she was always in financial trouble  if she wanted a fur collar a ratty little fur collar she had to figure out a way to make some extra money to get it
god thats universal
and she always had a domineering figure over her
lucy was forever knocking somebodys top hat off
miss balls personal favorite episodes were filmed when she was pregnant with desi jr an amazing  million viewers  of the television audience gleefully watched on jan   when she gave birth on film to the shows little ricky
to the unabashed delight of a nation it was the same night she had given birth in real life
i was so damned happy  just floating on a cloud  and i think the way i felt came across on the film she said
i loved doing all those pregnant shows
astoundingly or so it seems in retrospect early reviews of miss balls talents gave little hint of what was to come
in fact when she was a plucky yearold looking for that first break on broadway miss ball was told by a drama teacher to give up
luckily the turquoiseeyed teenager ignored the advice
born to an electrician father and pianist mother on aug   in a suburb of jamestown ny miss ball had set her sights on stardom almost from the first
by  the brownhaired little girl was taking music lessons
each spring that followed she would head toward new york city walking until someone found her and returned her to her home
leaving school at  miss ball finally made it to new york and the john murray anderson dramatic school
there was a brief stint in a ziegfeld follies road show and some shortlived appearances in a handful of broadway chorus lines
changing her name to diane belmont i always loved the name diane and i was driving past the belmont race track and the names seemed to fit together she turned to modeling
at various times a dress model and a hat model miss ball with long legs peeking out the bottom of a oversized cigarette pack ultimately became a chesterfield girl
america grew to know her on billboards magazine ads and on posters in its drugstore windows
then in  she headed to hollywood
her curly hair bleached a jean harlow platinum miss ball was hired to work for six weeks in the chorus of samuel goldwyns roman scandals
bit part after bit part stretched her stay to six months and she became a hollywood fixture taking second billing in the years that followed to everyone from the three stooges and buster keaton to katharine hepburn and spencer tracy
along the way she dyed her hair a fiery red and was given the unofficial title of queen of the bs
reviewers noted her pert presence and talent for rubberfaced slapstick clowning
she was described in one newspaper as a slangy breezy wisecracking gal with a bebop rhythm to her walk
said another pretty lucille ball 
was born for the parts ginger rogers sweats over
playing the ingenue lead in the  musical too many girls miss ball met rumba singer arnaz cast as a cuban football player
she later told an interviewer it was at least for me true love from the start
exchanging vows seven months later the pair began what was for the most part a troubled marriage
all but three of their first  years of marriage were spent apart
with arnaz traveling the country with his band and miss ball committed to hollywood sound stages the pair spent almost  on telegrams and longdistance telephone calls
we would end up talking on the phone  no fighting on the phone miss ball told interviewers
you cant have a marriage over the phone
you cant have children over the phone
it became obvious that something had to be done
what was done to salvage the marriage was i love lucy
since cbs was stubbornly opposed to the idea of the heavily accented arnaz playing the husband the determined arnazes created their own desilu company and took a stage version of their show on the road to gauge public opinion
it was a smash and television executives reluctantly gave i love lucy a time slot
i wanted our characters to have problems miss ball said of her concept for the show
i wanted to be an average housewife
a very nosy but very average housewife
and i wanted my husband to love me
cbs thought we were out of our minds to want to do it on film
the episodes were filmed before a live audience by academy awardwinning cinematographer karl freund famous for his work on such films as the good earth and garbos camille
when the arnazes negotiated to keep the films to show our kids someday few in the industry predicted what would happen
i remember someone saying these films may be worth something someday  miss ball told the times
you should hang onto them
if desi had that in mind i never knew it
maybe he knew he was creating the rerun but he never told me about it
all i knew was i was  years old and was having my first baby and i didnt want to do these shows and let them disappear into the air
i felt we could save the films for home movies
instead in the years since the original  i love lucy episodes were telecast they have been shown and reshown in virtually every country around the globe earning an estimated  million to  million
miss balls face was one of the most recognized on earth
but all of it was not enough to save her troubled marriage
to the horror of their television fans miss ball and arnaz were divorced in 
he arnaz was like jekyll and hyde she said years later
he drank and he gambled and he went around with other women
it was always the same booze and broads
breaking with the past miss ball left hollywood for new york and a starring role in the musical wildcat
the  production floundered after only a few performances but during her stay in the east she met standup comedian gary morton
they married in 
meanwhile arnaz and miss ball had sold their i love lucy films to cbs for  million and she bought her exhusbands interest in desilu becoming in effect the first woman to head a major studio
it was by then home to  shows including such hits as the untouchables and the ann sothern show
friend bob hope called her business sense startling
i never wanted to be an executive but when my marriage to desi broke up after  years i couldnt just walk away from my obligations and say forget it  miss ball explained
we were an institution
life takes guts
if you dont take chances youll never bathe again because you might get dirty again
husband morton said miss ball was blessed with an innate business sense
when she was running desilu he said she made decisions affecting the future of the company that often amazed board members not because they were coming from a woman but because time usually proved her judgment to be correct
among the shows miss ball tutored to success was her own the lucy show a series without arnaz but with the same madcap clowning that kept her fans delighted
among the guest stars attracted by the madness were elizabeth taylor and richard burton the most glittering couple of the day
in  with desilu churning out a gold mine of televisions hits star trek and mission impossible among them an exhausted miss ball decided that she had had enough
gulf  western industries bought the property for a reported  million
in place of desilu miss ball along with morton launched the much smaller lucille ball productions inc and in  began filming heres lucy a series featuring desi jr and lucie
my life started when my children were born miss ball said at the time
i couldnt wait to work with them
even when they moved out of the house they were still home at the studio
i liked that
the series aired through 
with her childrens careers off the launching pad the comedienne then  decided it was time to retire her legendary character
the lucy character is too old to run around like an idiot she said in explanation
that same year she filmed her final motion picture mame a version of the broadway musical
although by now the worlds bestknown television star as a movie star miss ball again received mixed reviews
times critic charles champlin wrote the shame about mame is that it managed to deny us a lucy to love
with those final starring credits to her name she settled into coproducing shows making occasional television appearances and accepting one after another of a continual barrage of awards and tributes
in addition to her  emmy nominations she won four miss ball was feted in  with a nostalgic television tribute saluting the th anniversary of i love lucy
danny kaye was among those who gave testimonials during the two hours of reminiscing
calling lucille ball just a comedienne is like calling margot fonteyn just a dancer kaye said
in  when she was named one of seven initial inductees in the television hall of fame she credited the many talented and creative people around her for making her a legend
i have been absolutely blessed miss ball said
role as bag lady the following year she took on one of the most challenging roles of her career a bag lady in the television movie stone pillow
she was hospitalized for dehydration when it was over but it was a critical and ratings success
her last flirtation with television came with her illfated and shortlived  series life with lucy in which she again teamed with longtime sidekick gale gordon
it was quickly pulled by the network because of abysmal ratings
her final public appearance proved to be during the st annual academy awards ceremony on march  when she joined her old friend hope as a presenter
she had signed a contract with putnam to publish her autobiography but died before she could begin work on it
tearfully sentimental when it came to her husband and family she reveled in life as a grandmother and glowed whenever she talked of her children
their struggles and early failed marriages seemed not to matter
while she always spoke fondly of arnaz miss ball claimed that she had found the perfect mate in morton
he morton takes care of me like i was his mother she told an interviewer in 
gary gives me protection
on a scale of  to  miss ball said i rate my marriage to gary a 
but to her countless television fans  from the postwar babies who adored her during the s to their children and childrens children who roared at her antics through decades of reruns  it was always lucy and ricky
more than a quartercentury of marriage to morton could not erase that
there was always the hilarious image of the redhead and that cuban bongo player as miss ball affectionately called him
even years after the lucy shows ended the comedienne openly admitted to missing the characterization
after lucy ended i thought ill live a few more years and then ill die she said in 
i didnt plan on living this long
now i miss her

 the countrys future course depends however on who remains in power
although yeltsin supported gorbachev during the coup the two men maintain different approaches to soviet reforms

 the radio said officials of the russian republic would try to intercept the plane and have its passengers arrested
 but sources at the airport told the associated press that only kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov was on a plane and it was headed to the crimea where gorbachev reportedly had been placed under house arrest
he reportedly was accompanied by communist party no
 leader vladimir ivashko
 the republicrun russian information agency said vice president gennady yanayev the nominal head of the coup committee was still in his kremlin office
the report could not be independently confirmed and the discrepancies could not be clarified

honecker  and in failing health and several other members of his ousted regime already have been charged with corruption and abuse of power
the murder charge could put honecker behind bars for life but his poor health makes prosecution questionable

mielke was ordered jailed

the white house is making sure nobody will accuse it of taking this crisis lightly
in the aftermath of the california earthquake president bush and his aides flew into a whirlwind of earthquakerelated activity yesterday morning
some of it was necessary to get federal help flowing to victims but some seemed designed mostly to project an image of a white house in action
mr bush and his aides were accused of responding too slowly after the exxon valdez oil tanker split open in alaskan waters and hurricane hugo struck the carolina coast and they clearly dont want a repeat of those charges now
so the white house announced that mr bush got his first earthquake briefing of the day at  am from chief of staff john sununu
by noon mr bush had taken two phone calls from vice president dan quayle who was in california made a televised statement of concern signed a disaster proclamation received a written report from the federal emergency management agency and visited fema headquarters
mr bush himself essentially acknowledged that he and his aides were trying to head off criticism
on his fema visit mr bush said that he hoped there would be less carping about the emergency offices performance this time adding that the agency took a hit for its reaction to hurricane hugo
the white house already is talking of mr bush visiting the california earthquake site this weekend
he visited the hugo devastation but not until after local leaders urged him to do so

tankled troops quickly seized the rulers palace and government buildings and the emir fled to saudi arabia kuwaiti officials said
kuwaits us ambassador said the iraqis occupied all government buildings in the capital and were moving south toward the countrys oil facilities
he appealed for us military intervention
the iraqis have occupied all of kuwait
a kuwaiti government official shouted in a telephone interview
diplomatic sources in the persian gulf estimated that more than  kuwaitis were killed or wounded
the iraqi government of president saddam hussein claimed that it invaded at the request of revolutionaries who had already staged a coup and established the provisional government of free kuwait
kuwait and un diplomats labeled the coup report a farce
baghdad television said iraq could withdraw its forces within days or weeks depending on how quickly the situation stabilized
the assault followed two weeks of tension between kuwait and iraq caused by iraqi accusations that kuwait stole oil from a disputed border area
saddam also accused kuwait of exceeding opec production quotas thus driving down the price of oil a major iraqi revenue source
in recent days diplomats said iraq had massed more than  troops at the border
kuwaits entire armed forces has  soldiers
it was the first time in modern history that an arab nation had invaded another and taken over its government
kuwaits army was no match for iraq battlehardened after eight years of war with iran
diplomats said about  iraqi tanks wheeled into the capital a few hours after crossing the border  miles away at dawn
witnesses said the bombardment of ports and military airports by artillery and the air force was vicious
the invaders surrounded the palace of kuwaits ruler sheik jabbar al ahmed al sabah
residents said the palace was seized after about two hours of heavy artillery barrages
diplomats said sheik fahd al ahmed al sabah one of the emirs brothers was killed while trying to defend the palace
there were about  tanks around the palace and the neighboring american embassy residents said
the al sabah family has ruled the citystate for almost  years
the kuwaiti ambassador said the leaders were safe in saudi arabia
operating from an unknown location al ahmeds government responded to the formation of the provisional government by stating kuwait is kuwait to its people led by the emir sheik jabbar and his crown prince sheik saad
god preserve them from all harm
for its part the provisional government announced through baghdads official iraqi news agency that it was dissolving parliament and would hold free and honest elections at a future date

president corazon aquino said friday that for security reasons she would not permit deposed president ferdinand e marcos to be buried in the philippines
marcos was reported to be in very critical condition in honolulu where he has lived in exile since his ouster in 
hospital officials there said that he rallied slightly friday but remained in extremely critical condition
the yearold former president has been suffering from heart lung and kidney disorders as well as pneumonia
his frail body attached to a respirator and a hemodialysis bloodcleansing machine marcos is unconscious most of the time but occasionally shows faint signs of life doctors in hawaii said
medical sources said that he is being treated with antibiotics and heart medication but that he could die at any time
radio stations here broadcast hourly reports on marcos condition
philippine officials were asked repeatedly whether the aquino governments refusal to allow marcos to return to the country would remain in effect after his death
one radio station broadcast an interview with marcos wife imelda at the st francis medical center in honolulu where she was said to be maintaining a vigil at his bedside
she was quoted as appealing to aquino to open her heart and allow marcos to return to the philippines
aquino said she would not alter her position but that she had prayed for marcos recovery
i regret to inform mrs marcos that as much as i agree that mr marcos has his rights i still have to consider also the rights and the interests of millions of filipinos aquino told reporters at the presidential palace
i have said 
in the past that we will not allow his remains to be brought back here and we have already taken plans to avoid any untoward incident
nonetheless marcos supporters announced that they will march through the capital today to support the former presidents demand that he be allowed to die in the philippines
despite charges that marcos and his inner circle looted the government treasury of billions of dollars the former president still has a significant following here
in the philippines personal loyalty is considered a sacred debt
attempted coups government officials have accused marcos supporters of taking part in at least two attempted coups against the aquino government
aquino evidently is concerned that even after death the return of marcos remains could spark violence or galvanize opposition to her government
aquinos national security adviser rafael ileto told reporters friday that the philippine army is prepared for any emergency that might be provoked by the death of the former president
he was quoted as saying that while marcos is no longer a threat to the government his supporters can still cause disruption
marcos mother josefa died a year ago but because marcos has been barred from this country the family refuses to have her remains interred
a newspaper advertisement published on the first anniversary of her death may  said funeral arrangements will be announced
marcos and his wife have been indicted by a federal grand jury in the united states on charges of racketeering fraud and extortion
marcos has been excused from appearing in court up to now because of his failing health
imelda marcos is free on  million bail

the communist party today admitted that east germanys socialist system has failed and expressed support for a type of partnership with west germany
the statement in the communist party newspaper neues deutschland was one of the bluntest official assessments to date of the countrys increasingly troubled situation
it came a day after shouting matches broke out over german reunification during prodemocracy protests in leipzig and dresden
also today secretary of state james a baker iii urged caution on the reunification issue
he visited the berlin wall and met with west german chancellor helmut kohl and east german premier hans modrow
in another development the largest opposition movement new forum announced it will take part as a political party in the countrys first free elections scheduled for may 
neues deutschland in proposing a new party platform said socialism has definitely failed as a social system in our country and acknowledged that the popular revolutionary movement of the past weeks had led to the scrapping of the old system
the paper repeated the communists promise to work for a new democratic socialism within a multiparty system
during the past few weeks both germanys have increased business and cultural ties but have debated what labels to use for closer relations since the east berlin government rejects calls for reunification
neues deutschland urged a qualified partnership of both german states but rejected any suggestions of resolving the german question
during mondays demonstrations that drew more than  protesters the largest of them the nowweekly rally in the southern city of leipzig speakers warned that the reunification issue could fracture the popular movement that has forced the ruling communists into swift retreat
one sign said germany united fatherland using a phrase from the west german national anthem
others opposing reunification urged no fourth reich and no transformation of east germany into west germanys plantation
adn said  people demonstrated for reunification in karlmarxstadt while several thousand people split into pro and antireunification groups at a rally in dresden
smaller rallies were also reported by adn in schwerin potsdam neubrandenburg and halle
the agency did not say if reunification played a role in those protests
the rallies came shortly after the four victorious world war ii allies met in west berlin to discuss the latest developments in east germany and berlin  the divided city that they still technically administer
the meeting brought together officials of the united states france and britain with soviet officials who have increasingly expressed concern over calls in both germanys to reunite the country
kohl has advocated a confederation of the two germanys to be followed by eventual reunification
but he stressed to reporters on monday that the goal of our policies is not to create an overpowering germany in the middle of europe
the west german leader advocates a reunified germany that would respect the security needs  and borders  of the rest of europe
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev during a central committee in moscow on saturday urged the west not to try to influence developments in east germany
east germany is a front line of defense for the soviets who have nearly  troops in the country
adn said gorbachev would meet soon with gregor gysi a reformer who was chosen east german communist party chief on saturday
gysis rise followed the ouster of two sets of communist leaders
since east germans began agitating for an end to communist domination two months ago public pressure has forced the opening of the berlin wall and pushed the communists to promise free elections and relinquish their political monopoly
but a unique subset has formed people who like to do both at the same time
and to help these folks along companies arrange tours for marathon vacations
the result
bangkok in november london in april and stockholm in may
 skiers have mountain ranges tennis players have resorts why cant a runner take a marathon vacation
said thorn gilligan president of marathon tours in boston
a runner should be able to enjoy a closed city for a day
its a celebration for the sport as much as a competition
 gilligan took  people last year on  tours to countries from bermuda to moscow
in addition to air fare and hotel runners are guaranteed spots in restricted entry races such as the london marathon
qualifying times are not required
 london the most popular european city to visit holds the worlds largest marathon april  next year
berlins race sept   has grown with the demise of the wall
 most marathons take you through cities so you get a chance to see things youd never see on a sightseeing bus said fred lebow president of the new york roadrunners club and director of the new york marathon
lebow has run in  marathons including london paris rome stockholm iceland seoul and vienna
 the most exciting thing is the start of the race he said
each city has something unique
 the cities are different but most marathons include a carboloading pasta party the night before medical exams a postrace celebration commemorative tshirts and awards to finishers
entry fees vary brussels is  venice 
 marathon tours includes the entry price in the package
going to bermuda for example costs approximately  from san francisco
the price includes roundtrip air fare four days and three nights at the grotto bay beach hotel per person based on double occupancy full breakfasts and dinners a welcome cocktail party and postrace parties and discounts
 england has similar organizations sports tours international and keith prowse a company that specializes in british theater sports and concert tours
 but it isnt necessary to run  miles to go on a running vacation especially if its a family trip
some marathons like portlands include additional races a fivemile run a fivemile walk and a kids run
tel aviv has a halfmarathon and a fun run
budapest offers a halfmarathon and a minimarathon along the danube
 there are also trips that incorporate running into the sightseeing schedule
running coach pat savage and hal higdon a senior writer for runners world are taking a group to ireland in june
the eightday trip will leave from chicago and will include sightseeing guided runs and a fun run from malahide castle to swords
 on a running vacation you plan something around running everyday higdon said
we know the unique scenic routes and put together special runs
 some runs are intriguing because of current events
the tel aviv marathon course went past houses hit by scud missiles during the gulf war
the belgrade marathon was held despite yugoslavias turmoil
the munich course is the same as the  olympic route and finishes in the same stadium
 running  miles just to see a city definitely isnt for everyone but at the very least its a way to kill two birds with one stone
in the recent chicago marathon a german man ran with a camera snapping photos every few miles

world leaders sent japan messages of condolences and some declared states of mourning after emperor hirohitos death saturday but painful memories of world war ii still generated criticism of the japanese monarch
president reagan said hirohitos year reign spanned one of the most tumultuous and yet at the same time constructive eras in the history of mankind
it was also an era of unprecedented reconciliation
his majesty played a truly heroic role in bringing hostilities between our two peoples to an end reagan said referring to hirohitos decision to end world war ii
president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union sent his sincere condolences and profound sympathy to the japanese people
his twosentence telegram made no mention of wartime hostilities with what still is known officially as militarist japan
the kremlin currently is striving for better ties and increased trade with japan
india declared a threeday national state of mourning in honor of hirohito and norways king olav v announced a threeweek court mourning
president francois mitterrand of france opened an international conference on chemical weapons with a minute of silence
but some reaction to hirohitos death was cool in south korea which endured years of harsh colonial rule by japan
while president roh taewoo of south korea sent his condolences a government party statement added we reserve further comment considering the unhappy past and the current koreajapan relationship
china extended condolences and taiwan said it will send a delegation to the funeral
but taiwans daily united evening news said it was an irony that while hirohito apologized to the united states and europe for the war he did not direct a single word to china to show his sorrow
most historians believe hirohito was a powerless figurehead but had approved orders that led to the attack on pearl harbor and put most of east asia under an often brutal japanese rule
hirohito called on his nation to surrender in 
the emperors death drew mixed reaction in the netherlands which lost more than  people under japans wartime occupation of the former dutch east indies
the government said it sent its sympathy for the loss that has befallen the japanese people without mentioning the name of hirohito branded a war criminal by survivors of the wartime occupation of the colony that became indonesia in 
to many war victims only now has world war ii finally come to an end said gen ruud boekholt chairman of the august  commemoration foundation a group representing  dutch citizens who underwent japanese internment
daily they still feel the pain of the wartime suffering that was inflicted on them in the name of emperor hirohito boekholt told the associated press
but indonesian president suharto cabled his condolences to crown prince akihito hirohitos eldest son who immediately ascended the chrysanthemum throne and said he will personally pay the last homage to hirohito presidential spokesman moerdiono said
pope john paul ii expressed his condolences and sent telegrams to hirohitos family vatican radio reported
queen elizabeth ii said she was saddened and prime minister margaret thatcher said she shares the japanese peoples sorrow
but opposition lawmakers said britain should boycott his funeral
no one should go to that funeral from this country said ron brown a lawmaker of the opposition labor party who denounced hirohito as a war criminal of the worst kind
it would be a grave insult to the many men and women  imprisoned in slave camps he said
many of them died but those who survived still suffer today
king juan carlos of spain king faisal of saudi arabia and other persian gulf monarchs king birendra of nepal and sultan mahmood iskandar of malaysia also sent condolences to akihito
brazil called hirohito a superior symbol of the japanese nation its culture and its anxieties in a period of drastic transformations in the world and his country and in a time of grave new challenges in the world

hurricane hugo will go down in the record books as the costliest storm insurers have faced so far but it wont cause propertycasualty premium rates to rise immediately analysts and company officials say
the property claims service division of the american insurance service group a trade association is expected to announce its estimate of total insured losses tomorrow
hugo will be the biggest hurricane loss on record said one official far surpassing the  million insurers paid out after frederick ripped through several gulf coast states in 
the impact on premium rates could be minimal for now analysts expect because the biggest losses will be in the personal insurance area  for homes and autos
most companies typically set aside funds from premiums they collect every year to cover claims they might have to pay in the future
in the last three years hurricane and storm seasons have been relatively mild so insurers havent had to dip into these funds
and since hugo also stormed through the caribbean foreign insurers are at risk for some of the damage on those islands
yet some analysts believe hugos huge losses will make a dent in the industrys capital and crimp cash flow that could make insurers less likely to slash premium rates further in coming months
rates have been falling since late 
udayan ghose at shearson lehman hutton inc believes these reasons might cause rates to edge higher by mid
for the time being the losses from hugo will be substantial but they wont be something the industry cant handle said charles l ruoff director of strategic planning at fred s james  co a new yorkbased insurance broker
for instance state farm mutual automobile insurance co estimates it will pay claims totaling more than  million to homeowners and for some small businesses
nationwide insurance co a mutual company based in columbus ohio said hugo is the single largest claims disaster it has seen in its year history
the company which is the largest home and auto insurer in north carolina and no
 in south carolina has already received  claims from the stricken region
claims could total  million a spokesman said
for some insurers hugo was a doublewhammy
new yorkbased continental corp which is a big insurer in puerto rico the virgin islands and south carolinas said it will take a  million pretax charge against earnings this quarter reflecting its net exposure to the damages caused by the hurricane
hugo will be particularly costly to us said john p mascotte continentals chairman
philadelphiabased cigna corp which has extensive domestic foreign and reinsurance operations in the areas hugo hit and usfg corp in baltimore a big insurer in the carolina region could also be forced to take onetime charges against thirdquarter earnings analysts said
some of usfgs losses hit very close home  its charleston office was destroyed by the hurricane
both usfg and cigna declined to predict whether they would take a charge usfg said it would be responsible for the first  million of losses and its reinsurance would cover the bulk of additional losses
hugo could have a marginal impact on thirdquarter income at travelers corp aetna life  casualty insurance co and chubb corp according to industry analysts
mr ruoff at fred s james believes that even if losses from hugo total as much as  billion insurers wont feel enough financial pain such as not being able to pay shareholder dividends to compel them to boost premium rates right away
he explained that in the first six months of this year net income for the industry declined slightly from  but insurance companies were still earning an adequate rate of return on equity
he also noted that the industrys aggregate net worth or policyholders surplus currently at  billion is also plentiful
generally insurers can book about  of premiums for every  of surplus
right now premiums total about  billion he said
an official at nationwide insurance noted that the company has  of surplus for every  of insurance that it writes
insurers also buy protection for themselves through reinsurance by paying another company a portion of the premium to bear some of the losses
michael lewis at dean witter reynolds said losses from hugo could be big enough to temporarily increase reinsurance rates
although reinsurance will limit the exposure of some companies the losses they must still cover could hurt thirdquarter results
niagara exchange corp based in buffalo ny said monday it will report a loss from operations for the third quarter and possibly for the year because of the substantial losses that its charleston insurance co unit faces as a result of the hurricane
state farm the nations largest home insurer doesnt buy reinsurance
it believes its reserves are plentiful enough to absorb its losses a spokesman said
another victim was dr nicholas davies presidentelect of the american college of physicians a member industry group said dr louis felder who worked with davies at piedmont hospital in atlanta
none of the  passengers or three crew members aboard atlantic southeast airlines flight  survived
 the crash followed by one day the planehelicopter collision that killed sen john heinz of pennsylvania and six other people
 tower  and his daughter marian  boarded the passenger turboprop embraer  in atlanta and were headed to sea island off the georgia coast for a party in towers honor
 officials said they did not know the cause of the crash
the plane was descending in clear weather authorities said when it went down at  pm about three miles northeast of the runway at the brunswickglynco jetport
 witnesses said the plane appeared to have fallen straight from the sky
 it just went straight down
there was no cropping of trees said lt jack hopper of the glynn county police department quoting witnesses
 it started in on its nose and i knew it was in trouble said james griner who lives a quartermile from the airport
i went to the plane but i couldnt get to it because of the fire
when i got to it it looked compacted
 atlantic southeasts senior vice president john beiser said officials had no indication from the pilot that the flight was in trouble
 donald day the airlines manager of consumer affairs described the aircraft as extremely sophisticated and fuelefficient one of the backbones of our commuter fleet
he said the plane was new and had been put in service in december
 the brazilianmade embraer  is manufactured by empresa brasileira de aeronautica sa
in  an embraer  bandeirante an earlier model of the  crashed in jacksonville fla killing  people
the federal aviation administration subsequently ordered an inspection of all embraers for possible sheared or worn rivets in the tail sections
 towers death prompted words of grief and praise among his former colleagues on capitol hill even those who helped derail his elevation to the cabinet in  im deeply saddened by the loss of john tower a tough able friend and patriot said sen lloyd bentsen dtexas who broke ranks with most democrats to support president bushs nomination of the year senate veteran to be defense secretary
he was intelligent and had independence of judgment
 senate armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga who led the successful fight against towers confirmation said america had lost a patriot
he fought for freedom and worked diligently to make the world more secure
 its so sad bush said
it is a tragic loss
the government today imposed direct federal rule in kashmir where indian security forces are battling to put down a rebellion by moslem separatists
the action follows the killing tuesday of at least  moslem militants by indian security forces
in the pakistani capital of islamabad meanwhile india and pakistan opened negotiations today aimed at repairing relations threatened by the rebellion in the disputed northern region
relations between pakistan and india worsened in january when indian soldiers cracked down on moslem militants in kashmir who are seeking independence from india or union with pakistan
at least  people have been killed in kashmir since then
india has accused pakistan of arming and training the militants a charge pakistan has denied
before direct federal rule was imposed today on jammukashmir state it was administered temporarily by a governor a federal representative since jan 
the announcement of federal rule reflected the belief that jammukashmir state was too unstable to be run by an elected local government
on tuesday at least  militants were killed by indian security forces in kashmir the moslemdominated northern part of jammukashmir state and the center of the secessionist campaign
officials who cannot be identified under briefing rules said  militants were killed in a battle with the border security force in poonch  miles northwest of new delhi
hours later in the same area troops killed eight militants who slipped across the border from pakistan said the officials
the guards also arrested four militants and seized  automatic rifles two machine guns and two rocket launchers the officials said
indian officials maintain that kashmiri militants regularly cross over to pakistan through the border and return by the same route after reciving arms training
pakistan denies it is training or helping the militants but calls the separatist struggle a fight for selfdetermination
india and pakistan have fought two previous wars over kashmir in  and 
both were won by india
about  percent of jammukashmirs  million people are moslems making it indias only moslem majority state
nationwide moslems make up  percent of indias  million people
hindus make up  percent of the population
kashmiri separatists earlier demanded union with pakistan an islamic country but they have recently been fighting for total independence and the status of a neutral country
two weeks after a failed launch attempt an improved discovery is ready to embark on one of the most momentous shuttle missions hoisting the hubble space telescope high enough to behold the threshold of time
the countdown began saturday afternoon for a launch set for  am edt tuesday
if the launch goes on schedule and all else goes well the first picture from hubble could be available next weekend
we are as excited maybe even more
you can cut it with a knife incredible said eric chaisson senior scientist at the space telescope science institute at johns hopkins university in baltimore
nothing at least scientifically seems to have been lost as a result of the twoweek wait one of numerous delays plaguing the mission since its original  launch date
as chaisson remarked last week the universe has been around for  billion years
a couple of weeks is not going to matter
the heavens look the same to me
the secrets are the same chaisson said
theres not a bit of difference agreed charles pellerin jr nasas director of astrophysics
i think the main point is the hubble space telescope still is in perfect condition
the  billion telescope the most expensive unmanned spacecraft ever built rests safely inside discoverys payload bay awaiting the tuesday launch
if all goes well discovery will return to edwards air force base calif on sunday april  with an empty payload bay
nasa said it may release its first telescope image from hubble  of an open star cluster in the constellation carina  as early as that same day
after the early test images are made and other preparatory work is done hubble is expected to start providing significant scientific data by satellite in a month or two
the observatory is considered the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo first used a telescope in 
it also is considered by many at nasa to be the most important shuttle mission to date it will be the th
the telescope is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s the universe constantly is expanding
his work gave rise to the theory the universe was created by a tremendous explosion about  billion years ago
from its perch far above earths obstructing atmosphere the telescope will be able to discern objects  times fainter and with  times greater clarity than the best groundbased observatory
astronomers are counting on hubble to unravel some of the mystery surrounding quasars pulsars and black holes
by studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to earth for  billion years they hope to determine the precise origin of the universe and learn whether other solar systems  and life forms  exist
if everything goes well its going to knock our socks off chaisson said
nasas sole attempt to launch discovery was halted four minutes before liftoff april  when one of the shuttles three auxiliary power units failed
the pound unit was replaced with a new one the first time nasa ever had installed such a unit at the launch pad
the procedure went so smoothly the space agency decided last week to advance the launch to tuesday a day earlier than planned
hubbles six nickelhydrogen batteries were returned to the telescope friday following  hours of recharging
the batteries will power hubble from the time it is disconnected from discoverys power system until its energycollecting solar panels are deployed  miles above earth the highest a shuttle has ever gone
astronaut steven a hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the pound telescope into space on the second day of the mission
the telescopes aperture door will be opened on the next to allow the first starlight to strike the mirror
mission specialists bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan veteran spacewalkers will leave the cabin to assist if necessary
the shuttle will follow hubble from  miles away in case a problem develops and the telescope must be retrieved and returned to earth
you can never eliminate those oddball quirks of fate or gremlins that may sneak up on any given day sullivan said
but those are very remote potentials i really suspect we wont encounter
in addition to the  billion cost of the telescope  million has been spent to stockpile spare parts train astronauts and develop computer software to operate the instrument
the european space agency contributed  million to the hubble project and will get to use the telescope  percent of the time
the earthquake that struck northern iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated soviet armenia in 
like thursdays earthquake in iran the dec   earthquake in armenia killed about  people
most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit
its very similar to what we had in armenia said russ needham a geophysicist with the us geological survey
the armenian quake was measured at  on the richter scale but thursdays earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of  according to the us geological survey
in the iranian quake the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time just after midnight
many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramictype brick or adobe that collapses easily
in the armenian quake a soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings
most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you said needham in a telephone interview from golden colo
the quake struck an area of iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse needham said
the magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area where two major plates of the earths crust meet he said
iran is in a very active seismic region he said and that there have been many smaller quakes
twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude  have occurred in iran during the last  years needham said
a quake of magnitude  is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage in populated areas

navy investigators will be looking at all possibilities of human or mechanical error in their effort to determine what caused the explosion that killed  aboard the battleship uss iowa officials say
it could take months before the probe is completed and the results released publicly navy spokesman lt cmdr
alan dooley said sunday
a sevenmember team of investigators boarded the battleship a day after the explosion flashed through the iowas no
 gun turret on wednesday
theyre looking at any evidence of human error or mechanical error or anything technical said lt janet mescus a spokeswoman at the navys information center at norfolk va the ships home port
the iowa returned to norfolk on sunday
theyre moving as quickly as they can lt mescus said but added they want to be thorough and that takes time
dooley said the investigation would be fairly complex because there were no witnesses
there were  survivors inside the turret all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ships magazines the navy said
dooley said no information would be released until the probe is completed and the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion which damaged only the inside of the turret
but the new york times reported sunday that navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the no
 guns breech open and undamaged with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there
the times cited unidentified sources as saying this indicated the explosion occurred while the bags containing  pounds of propellant powder were still being loaded into the gun
navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the newspaper said
they said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete the hoist would have been sealed off
the navy on sunday released an amateur videotape of the explosion which was made by an officer on the bridge of the iowa who wanted to record the firing of the guns
the investigation team is headed by rear adm richard d milligan former commanding officer of the battleship uss new jersey and it also includes experts on gunnery and weapons
president bush lost an irreplaceable pin supporting his mission in the persian gulf on thanksgiving day
he heard the news of margaret thatchers resignation as he celebrated the holiday in the saudi desert  and it clearly came as a shock
in the state department too it came as a shock
americans who had come to take thatcher for granted during her  years of power were not prepared for her passing
thatcher had told the world that she would fight to a second ballot after her narrow failure to retain the premiership outright on tuesday
the feeling everywhere was that thatcher always stuck to her word
so no problem
pass the turkey
thatchers friends all over the world had reckoned without the british conservative party which had looked at the opinion polls the bad economic news and an unpopular new tax and smelled a loss at the next election
they had reckoned without the hatred for the flamboyant michael heseltine among the middleranking party figures who risked losing their jobs and future prospects if the unpredictable tarzan came to power
it was an extraordinary scene in the palace of westminster on wednesday night as one by one her own cabinet members trooped sheepishly into thatchers office and told her in their chosen code that they couldnt support her over the weekend in the second round of secret balloting on the partys leadership
therefore if heseltine was to be beaten it had to be by someone else
after sleeping on it as one of her closest advisers put it thatcher reluctantly concluded that she had to go
thus did the toughest fighter for shared british and american values since winston churchill become the first prime minister to be forced out of office by the conservative party since the failed war leader neville chamberlain
when george bush recovered from his thanksgiving surprise he was generous in his praise
two years ago his words would have rung hollow
the president began his term in office without much trust in her
he had seen the influence she exerted over ronald reagan and was keen to be seen as his own man
he had heard her doubts over the pace of german reunification and the integration of europe and had been persuaded by his advisers that she stood against the united states best interests
gradually however that changed
at the beginning of the persian gulf crisis the president deliberately sought thatchers analysis
it was her assessment of the threat to international security posed by iraqi aggression that according to british and american sources set the moral framework for operation desert shield
the pivotal moment was when she fielded press questions about iraq on bushs behalf in the colorado mountain garden of the us ambassador to britain henry catto that marked the public turning point
she was able to articulate what bush sensed was right
and he was able to defer to her without embarrassment seeming almost gentlemanly in allowing her to go first
bush is unlikely to reach such a rapport with any of her three potential successors
heseltine is an exceptionally powerful orator but it hard to see that helping the tonguetied american president
douglas hurd the urbane foreign secretary is an english james baker the president already has a james baker
john major the chancellor of the exchequer and thatchers own choice to succeed her may have views very close to bushs
but he is mildmannered slightly clumsy and although widely liked and admired by his friends is almost wholly without international experience
the issue is no longer the angloamerican special relationship
it is margaret thatcher and ronald reagan who will go down in history as washington and londons last romantics
they were the ones who would each ditch their closest friends in order to support the other reagan when overruling jeane kirkpatricks objections to the falklands campaign and thatcher when blocking her own right wings protests at the us bombing of libya from british bases
they shared the conviction that communism could be rolled back  and she helped persuade him that mikhail gorbachev was a man who could be trusted
the powerful enunciation of that belief  and its eventual vindication  may be the last great achievement of the special postwar angloamerican alliance
george bush and margaret thatcher had something more simple in common a pragmatic relationship of mutual respect and support that benefited both
british policy toward iraq will not change suddenly under a new prime minister
the doubling of the size of the british gulf force on thursday attempted emphatically to prove that
but as time goes by britains allies will find that many certainties have passed along with margaret thatcher
if seductive deals emerge to save the face and the atomicweapon factories of saddam hussein her steadfastness will be sorely missed
and if europe becomes more inwardlooking and protectionist blame those who booted out the prime minister whose final words to her cabinet were its a funny old world
her memoirs deserve a more dignified title
hurricane gilbert slammed into kingston on monday with torrential rains and  mph winds that ripped roofs off homes and buildings uprooted trees and downed power lines
no serious injuries were immediately reported in the city of  people which was hit by the full force of the hurricane around noon
for half an hour the hurricane lashed the city tearing branches from trees blowing down fences and whipping paper through the air
the national weather service reported heavy damage to kingstons airport and aircraft parked on its fields
the first shock let up as the eye of the storm moved across the city
skies brightened the winds died down and people waited for an hour before the second blow of the hurricane arrived
all jamaicabound flights were canceled at miami international airport
flights from the cayman islands reportedly next in the path of the hurricane arrived in miami packed with travelers cutting short their vacations
people were running around in the main lobby of our hotel on grand cayman island like chickens with their heads cut off said one man
a national weather service report said the hurricane was moving west at  mph with maximum sustained winds of  mph
it said jamaica would receive up to  inches of rain that would cause flash floods and mud slides
right now its actually moving over jamaica said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in miami
it looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island and theyre going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane he said
gilbert reached jamaica after skirting southern puerto rico haiti and the dominican republic
hurricane warnings were issued monday for the south coast of cuba east of camaguey the cayman islands and haiti while warnings were discontinued for the dominican republic
high winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched kingston overnight toppling trees causing local flooding and littering streets with branches
most of jamaicas  million people stayed home boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane
the popular north coast resort area on the other side of the mountains was expected to receive heavy rain but not as much damage from the hurricane as the south coast where officials urged residents to seek higher ground
havana radio meanwhile reported monday that  people were evacuated from coastal areas in guantanamo province on the nations southeastern coast as gilberts winds and rain began to brush the island
in washington the navy reported its bases at guantanamo bay cuba and roosevelt roads puerto rico had taken various precautionary steps but appeared to be safe from the brunt of the hurricane
lt ken ross a spokesman said the navy station at guantanamo reported that as of  pm edt the brunt of the storm appeared to be passing southeastern cuba
they have reported maximum winds of  knots and gusts up to  knots said ross
but there are no reports of injuries or damage
the spokesman said earlier in the day guantanamo had moved to condition two meaning electrical power usage was cut back to only essential uses and all nonessential personnel sent to their barracks
the storm also skirted puerto rico without causing any damage to military facilities ross said
sheets said gilbert was expected next to sweep over the cayman islands on its westward track and in two to three days veer northwest into the southern gulf of mexico
residents of the neighboring caymans a british dependency to the northwest were urged to rush all preparatory actions
the national weather service warned that the caymans could expect high waters and large waves which may undermine buildings along the beaches

a fiery explosion in a giant gun turret rocked the refitted battleship iowa on maneuvers in the atlantic today killing at least  sailors and injuring an undetermined number the pentagon said
defense department spokesman dan howard said the explosion may have resulted from the blast of a pound gunpowder bag used to fire shells that weigh more than a ton a distance of up to  miles
the inch guns are the biggest in the navy arsenal
we assume it was a powder bag howard said in brussels
another spokesman said at least  crewmen were killed in the explosion that ripped through the turret when one of the giant guns was being fired during a training exercise about  miles northeast of puerto rico
no danger of sinking the crew extinguished the fire that broke out

the iowas inch guns are in three turrets
the explosion took place in the no
 turret
the guns are originals dating from the ships first commissioning at the height of world war ii in  as a sister ship of the missouri aboard which the japanese signed the warending surrender document
the powder bags are stored below decks in heavily armored magazines
defense officials traveling with cheney said seawater was pumped into the magazine where the fire and explosion occurred
each of the ships nine guns requires a crew of  to  to operate it with  to  people in the turret and the others below sending up shells and powder bags
the powder bags are loaded behind the shells
often refurbished its rather laborintensive a pentagon spokesman said
the iowa itself has been refurbished many times since it was commissioned and was most recently put back into service in december

anheuser busch is staging a bud bowl ii ad campaign that culminates during the jan  super bowl with a game featuring animated teams of budweiser and bud light beer bottles rattling around on a pintsized football field
the first such game was staged during the last super bowl

the coup people as president bush dubbed them could not have miscalculated more profoundly
they thought the issue was mikhail gorbachev and apparently believed that by neutralizing gorbachev and threatening everyone else they could quickly take charge of the country
 but the people of the soviet union apparently concluded that the real issue was not gorbachev himself but the new political culture of freedom and even democracy that his reforms had created
for the first time in their thousandyear history russians asserted their independence from autocracy and the autocrats fell
 there will be much to sort out in the months ahead
but almost certainly the failure of the counterrevolution will accelerate the democratic revolution it tried to choke
that revolution will alter the country creating a new decentralized and probably smaller soviet union much more quickly than anyone anticipated
 gorbachevs own standing also will be transformed by these events
it seems unlikely that he can escape the consequences of his own past miscalculations  especially the miscalculation that led him to embrace the very men who led this putsch against his rule
gorbachev was the most resourceful and creative political leader of the late th century but this week he was trumped by boris yeltsin who will now rightly be seen as the man who saved him
 yeltsin had two talents that gorbachev lacked
one was the ability to stay close to the russian people as their world was transformed by gorbachevs revolution  hence his thumping victory in this springs first presidential election in russia and gorbachevs abysmal standing in the polls
yeltsins second talent was his eagerness to challenge the apparatus of the soviet communist party the world from which both he and gorbachev emerged
 gorbachev could never shuck his party apparatchiks skin
instead of reaching out to new ideas and new people as yeltsin has he surrounded himself with traditional communist party officials and worried about the impact of new schemes and ideas
gorbachev thought vladimir kryuchkov of the kgb boris pugo of the ministry of interior dmitri yazov of the red army and gennady yanayev of the communist party were necessary bedfellows whose presence in his entourage could protect him from conservative forces that hated his reforms
instead they turned out to be mortal enemies
 if they had been only personal enemies gorbachev might have been undone by them
but when they closed the new liberal news media and reverted to the stalinist tradition of the big lie the members of the state emergency committee threatened not just gorbachev but also the new soviet union  a society that offered its citizens an unprecedented opportunity for dignity selfreliance and freedom
for years soviets and western kremlinologists had debated whether the changes that created this new soviet union were irreversible
tuesday it became clear that they were
 of course gorbachev initiated those changes and history will credit him for that
he also refused to acquiesce to the state of emergency that those responsible for the coup apparently asked him to endorse last weekend
 it is intriguing in assessing the coups failure that men trained as thugs by some of the most violent and meanspirited institutions created by any state could not in their moment of truth behave like thugs and kill their compatriots
they left gorbachev alive and yeltsin at large they let the western media report their coup as it unfolded and they allowed foreign radio stations to broadcast news of it back into the country
even their own news media under strict control conveyed the fact that there was widespread resistance to their attempted coup
 by tuesday night the emergency committee was in a confrontation with the political legitimacy of yeltsin and this proved an unequal contest
as gorbachev had previously discovered in his negotiations with yeltsin over a new union treaty the legitimacy provided by the  million votes that yeltsin received in the elections for president of the russian federation was a formidable political force
 at first blush the botching of the coup was surprising  couldnt the vaunted kgb and its allies run an efficient putsch
but these were representatives of the political class that turned one of the worlds richest nations into a basket case
perhaps their coup should be seen as a desperate and forlorn effort to deny a truth that proved undeniable  that the stalinist system had failed so utterly there was simply no way to redeem it
beijing  jun xinhua  according to the state flood control and drought relief headquarters after the largest or the second largest flood peaks since the liberation of china occurred a few days ago in the xi jiang bei jiang xiang jiang and gan jiang rivers water levels in these rivers are dropping slowly however high water levels will remain in these rivers for the next few days
due to interaction of the bei jiang and xi jiang the zhujiang delta will face a high waterlevel test
heavy rainfall over a wide area since midjune resulted in the largest flood waters since liberation of the country in the xi jiang bei jiang and xiang jiang rivers
the flood water in guangdongs xi jiang crested in gaoyao county on  june the water level in gaoyaos xi jiang dropped to  meters at  today
a flood peak occured in bei jiang in guangdongs sanshui at  on  june raising the water level to  meters  the largest flood level ever recorded
the water level droppped to  meters at  today
drops in water levels in guangdongs bei jiang and xi jiang do not mean that guangdongs flooding situations have eased because flood waters in the xi jiang and bei jiang will remain at high levels for quite long a period and will enter the sea after the two flood waters jointly flow through the lowlying zhujiang delta
in particular the sea tide may add to the flood waters on  june
with these factors combined the zhujiang delta which has a developed economy and a forest of factories will face the most rigorous flood water test since the liberation of the country
the situation in the xiang jiang is also not an easy one
the flood peak passed changsha on  june but the water level at the changsha station was still at  meters at  today  gmt  june
because the water level has remained high for a long period several dangerous situations have occured along the rivers dikes
dike reinforcing work needs to be stepped up
the flood peak in gan jiang entered boyang lake on  june
however due to continued rains over the last few days the water level in the upper reaches west of ganzhou has begun to rise again
at  today the water level at the ganzhou station was  meters  meters above the warning level
mourners sobbed and shook their heads in disbelief sunday as tens of thousands viewed the flowerdraped body of andrei d sakharov in a huge outpouring of grief for the man described as his countrys conscience
crimean tatars and jewish refuseniks  two of the groups sakharov helped  joined rankandfile communists teachers and engineers in filing past the body of the physicist nobel peace prize winner human rights advocate and legislator
based on official sources an estimated  people filed through and the flow of mourners continued into the night
a friend of the family speaking on condition of anonymity said he heard estimates that  mourners viewed the body before it was returned to sakharovs apartment at midnight
my god
forgive us
one elderly woman cried out as she saw sakharovs body in an open coffin sloping to the floor of the beige marble youth palace in central moscow
she apparently meant to apologize for not recognizing his contributions earlier
a mound of red and white carnations grew steadily at sakharovs feet and a spotlight was focused on a portrait showing sakharov with his hands over his mouth deep in thought
an organ and piano alternated dirges
sakharov died thursday alone in his study at the age of  apparently of a heart attack ending a threedecade fight against the jailing of innocent people for free emigration for disarmament and other causes
sunday was the first of two days of memorial ceremonies and the outpouring was remarkable for a man who was once ostracized and committed to nearly seven years in internal exile in the remote city of gorky
there were signs of grief throughout this snowy capital of  million people as though a government leader had died
the huge line of mourners sometimes four deep and heavily bundled against belowzero temperatures stretched a mile from the palace and poured continuously out of a subway station
so many people wanted to see sakharovs body lying in state that authorities extended the viewing period by four hours and moved the coffin so two rows of mourners could file past
roald z sagdeyev a member of the official funeral commission said about  people an hour were arriving initially but the official news agency tass said that rate doubled later making for a total of  by nighttime
police lined the sidewalks where people waited
sakharovs widow yelena bonner pleased authorities were not turning people away praised them for being very democratic
in her first detailed public comments on her husbands death bonner said she hopes he will not be idolized
i would not wish a living person  he has lived an animated happy life  to be turned into an icon an icon which could be used by various forces in their interests bonner said in an interview broadcast on soviet tv
she said however that she hopes sakharovs writings published abroad long ago will become widely available in his homeland so there can be a conversation of the people of the future with andrei dmitrievich
mourners carried small portraits of sakharov and red and white carnations to place near his coffin
one man sergei kosykh brought his yearold daughter along
my daughter who is being brought up with the belief that there is nobody greater than soviet founder vladimir lenin i have brought her here today just to show her the person greater than lenin he said
a middleaged woman drew from russian literature to reflect on sakharovs contributions
he was like the man from one of maxim gorkys tales who used his own bleeding and living heart as a torch to lead people to light and truth said the woman a teacher who declined to give her name
sakharov always was telling the truth and by doing so forced our leadership to do the same said boris sorokin a yearold designer
unofficial shrines sprouted outside sakharovs southeast moscow apartment where candles flickered alongside his portrait
outside the offices of the weekly newspaper moscow news on pushkin square a popular gathering place for political activists portraits and flowers were displayed
an entry in a notebook for mourners comments outside sakharovs apartment building declared the conscience of the nation has died
moscow news  an organ of the official press which had branded sakharov an utterly ignorant person  took the rare step sunday of publishing a special edition devoted to the activist
four pages were filled with pictures of him condolence telegrams from exiled writer alexander solzhenitsyn and president bush and a text of sakharovs last public remarks a speech he delivered hours before his death in which he said the soviet hierarchy was leading the country to a catastrophe
on sunday night soviet tvs newscast seven days also paid tribute to sakharov leading the program with a minute report on him
the communist party daily pravda published a poem by yevgeny yevtushenko that read in part historys most peaceful rebel in dying did not come down from the cross but left a horrifying hole in the moral fabric of the world
on saturday pravda published what amounted to a public apology to sakharov
president mikhail s gorbachev and other soviet leaders said in an obituary that sakharov had been the victim of gross injustices and praised him as a man of honesty and sincerity
bonner sakharovs constant companion and fellow human rights activist sat closest to the coffin clutching a black handbag and periodically closing her eyes
a son and daughter from his first marriage and son and daughter of bonner also attended along with four grandchildren
gorbachev was expected to pay his last respects monday when the funeral is planned and on sunday was represented by yevgeny m primakov chairman of the funeral commission and a nonvoting member of the countrys ruling politburo
the foreign dignitaries expected to take part in mondays ceremonies include lech walesa head of polands solidarity movement who will be making his first trip to the soviet union and former refuseniks yosef begun and vladimir slepak who now live in israel
israels best known soviet dissident natan sharansky was refused a visa when he applied for permission to travel to moscow said sharanskys spokesman avraham benyaakov
begun and slepak said they would lay a wreath on sakharovs grave in sharanskys name

soviet human rights activist andrei d sakharov said sunday that his country is on the brink of economic catastrophe because reforms of the old centralized system are too slow in arriving
while praising the new course in world affairs taken by the soviet union as demonstrated by its withdrawal from afghanistan sakharov told the congress of the italian socialist party that some aspects of internal affairs are deeply disturbing
we all know about the serious economic situation which can only get worse
the budget deficit has reached astronomical proportions of more than  billion rubles  billion
economic reforms are proceeding slower and slower and people are losing interest in them because they cant buy anything
the old centralized system is being dismantled and that is right
but the trouble is that it is not being replaced by anything new
we can say that the country is on the brink of an economic catastrophe
sakharov who did not mention the name of president mikhail s gorbachev described as antidemocratic some measures taken to quell nationalist unrest particularly the toxic gas believed to have been used against demonstrators in soviet georgia earlier this year
the physicist also attacked new legislation on personal responsibility now under consideration in moscow
he said the laws could restrict freedom of speech
speaking in russian without notes he said the new laws were supposed to take the place of measures used against dissidents like himself in the s and s
sakharov was elected in april to the new soviet congress of peoples deputies just two years after he was released from seven years of internal exile
gorbachev was set to board a plane in the crimea where he was vacationing at the time of mondays coup for the twohour flight to moscow said a deputy to russian defense minister konstantin kobets
earlier reports that the plane had already taken off were incorrect officials said
 the soviet leader in a statement for radio and television said he was fully in command of the situation and that the coup leaders would bear full responsibility for their actions
 in the united states president bush hailed gorbachevs return to power and said the coup leaders had underestimated the power of the people underestimated what a taste of freedom and democracy brings
 the threeday coup one of the most tumultuous developments in recent soviet history unraveled in a series of swift and dramatic developments today check tanks and armored personnel carriers moved away from the russian parliament scene of the worst violence of the coup
a  milelong column of tanks and trucks headed out of moscow
 check the leaders of the national legislature demanded gorbachevs reinstatement
the full legislature nullified the coup leaders emergency decrees
 check press restrictions were lifted
im sorry comrades but im very excited
said a soviet tv announcer grinning broadly after he was allowed for the first time to criticize the coup leaders actions
 check the communist party apparently seeking to salvage its own image denounced the takeover
 check in the secessionist baltic republics which had borne the brunt of the postcoup crackdown some soviet troops began returning to their permanent bases
latvia joined neighbor estonia today in declaring immediate independence from the soviet union
 the coups failure could deal a fatal blow to organized highlevel efforts to thwart reform drives in the soviet union by gorbachev and yeltsin and significantly alter the balance of power that has characterized soviet power for the sixyear gorbachev era
 the countrys future course depends however on who remains in power
although yeltsin supported gorbachev during the coup the two men maintain different approaches to soviet reforms
 yeltsin addressed the russian parliament today and said the soviet union had just gone through a most tragic moment in its history and perhaps the most tragic moment
 gorbachevs foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh who had dropped out of sight during the coup reappeared today and called the takeover a page in soviet history that has got to be turned
 the national legislature invalidated all decrees made by the coup leaders national lawmaker yuri karyakin told the russian legislature
karyakin said the legislatures executive council demanded gorbachevs return to power
 with the coups demise the communist party moved to salvage its own credibility
it called the takeover unconstitutional and demanded a meeting with gorbachev the party chief the official news agency tass said
the party renounced any connection with the coup leaders
 thousands of people had kept up their vigil at the russian parliament building after overnight clashes with soviet troops that left at least four dead
they cheered when the announcement of the coup committees departure came over a loudspeaker
 this shows the strength of our democracy said leonid abramtsov who was marching with a band of teenagers waving the red white and skyblue flag of the russian republic
 the plane reportedly carrying the coup leaders was said to be headed to the city of bishkek formerly called frunze the capital of kirgizia  miles southeast of moscow according to radio russia which speaks for yeltsin
it was not immediately known why the coup leaders would travel to kirgizia
 but sources at the airport told the associated press that only kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov was on a plane and it was headed to the crimea
he reportedly was accompanied by communist party no
 leader vladimir ivashko
 the republicrun russian information agency said vice president gennady yanayev the nominal head of the coup committee was still in his kremlin office
the report could not be independently confirmed and the discrepancies could not be clarified
 despite the force brought to bear by the coup leaders they were unable to dislodge yeltsin from the russian parliament where he rallied the opposition to enforce the curfew or prevent large demonstrations nationwide
 the state of emergency was declared after hardline elements in the military and communist party ousted gorbachev declaring he was ill the junta had seemed unable to cope with tens of thousands of people who erected barricades around yeltsins stronghold in the parliament
 there were also huge anticoup demonstrations in moscow leningrad kishiniev and other cities as well as strikes by coal miners in siberia
 early today before the coup fell apart columns of tanks and armored personnel carriers had moved around central moscow
one patrol of the armored vehicles was trapped by furious demonstrators just after midnight as it tried to break through a barricade
 two people were confirmed shot or crushed to death as the vehicles tried to fight their way through and witnesses said a third person was killed
a russian republic official col viktor samailov told the independent news agency interfax that four people were shot or crushed to death in the clash

five astronauts boarded discovery today for a second try at sending the hubble space telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time
astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the hubble will be able to accomplish said lennard fisk head of nasa science activities
air force forecasters said there was a  percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of  am edt
more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ships fuel tanks after midnight
the astronauts wearing bright orange flight suits climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the kennedy space center
the  billion telescope nasas costliest cargo will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we dont have said william lenoir head of nasas space flight program
its going to change our perspective altogether
i cant say what were going to learn but ill be astounded if we dont learn many new things
discovery was aiming for an altitude of  miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere
it is the th shuttle mission
columbia which journeys into space next month with the astro observatory sat on a launch pad  miles from discovery only the second time both pads have been occupied the first was in  just before the challenger explosion
hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since  delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident
the latest postponement occurred april  when discoverys launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle
the mood at the kennedy space center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families
the day after launch mission specialist steven a hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the pound telescope into space
veteran spacewalkers bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan will assist if a problem develops
discovery will follow hubble from  miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff
however nasa said it will release its first image  an open star cluster in the constellation carina  a week after launch
in addition to the  billion cost of hubble  million has been spent on spare parts astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument
the european space agency contributed  million for  percent of the viewing time
nasa estimates it will cost  million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space
during its year working lifetime the telescope will provide astronomers with  times better resolution and  times more sensitivity than groundbased observatories
as a result they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward earth for  billion years
astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created  billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies black holes and quasars
hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end
the telescope is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s that the universe is expanding
his work gave rise to the big bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion
in addition to hubble discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive
it is the skulls third trip into space
the shuttle is to end its fiveday mission with a landing at edwards air force base calif

the mayor also asked members of the organized jewish community to dissuade more radical groups from disrupting the visit the daily news said
mandela leader of the african national congress will visit eight cities from june  to july 
there is a danger of many people who hold nelson mandela in very very high esteem taking great umbrage at any public protest dinkins said

ousted east german leader erich honecker who is expected to be indicted for high treason was arrested monday morning upon release from a hospital and taken to prison the official news agency adn said
the news agency said the yearold honecker was arrested after being released from east berlins charite hospital where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor
honecker was immediately taken to east berlins rummelsburg prison the brief dispatch said
honecker joins other members of his ousted politburo already in prison awaiting trial
earlier this month east german prosecutors said honecker and former state security chief erich mielke would be charged with treason and corruption charges for misuse of their positions and state funds
honecker the aging hardline stalinist leader who ruled east germany for  years until his ouster on oct  had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment
adn said that the director of charite urology clinic dr peter althaus repeated on monday that in his opinion honecker was still not well enough to be jailed
on sunday west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper said honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition
adn made not mention if rummelsburg prison was equipped with a medical facility
earlier this month east germanys luthern church had offered to put honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital
at the news conference  gorbachevs first since the coup against him collapsed on wednesday  the yearold leader condemned the takeover as being against the people against democracy
 earlier he told reporters he would have killed himself rather than submit to any forced arrangement with the coup leaders
i said i wouldnt make any deals he said then
otherwise i would have had to commit suicide
 gorbachev detailed his purge of coup leaders including defense minister dmitri yazov
he named a new acting kgb chief interior minister and defense minister and said he would do everything to drive out the reactionary forces from the communist party
 gorbachev pledged cooperation with russian republic president boris yeltsin but said he had no plans to leave the communist party
 i am convinced that socialism is correct
i am an adherent of socialism
 when asked if yeltsin now had more power than he did gorbachev said we have been bound together by the situation
 looking and sounding angry he described the plotters as primitive and crude and crafty and scoffed at their announcement that he had stepped aside because he was ill their hands were shaking the whole time he said derisively
 despite his display of anger the soviet president said the failure of the coup could ultimately help ensure the continuation of his reforms
we have to see this as an enormous opportunity he said
 at his news conference gorbachev made a point of publicly praising yeltsin whose folkhero stature was enhanced during the coup as he rallied hundreds of thousands of his supporters to resist
 before dawn today gorbachev flew back to moscow from the crimea where he had been confined to his summer home during his brief ouster
 the soviet president who was reported to have slept for a few hours in his dacha outside moscow after returning from the crimea arrived at moscows vnukovo airport unannounced under heavy security
he looked somewhat disheveled clad in a windbreaker and a shirt with open collar
 appearing on soviet television after his arrival gorbachev looked haggard and unshaven with deep lines around his eyes and mouth
later at his news conference he at first spoke haltingly but then appeared to recover his composure and spoke in a forceful voice
 gorbachev said his captors cut off all communication and that his only source of news during the coup had been from foreign broadcasts including the bbc and voice of america received on a makeshift radio set up by his personal guards
 this has been a very difficult an extremely difficult lesson for me
its my you might say my drama he told reporters
 everything was done to weaken me psychologically gorbachev said
it was hard
it is hard to say it now but thats how it was
 he said that early on in the coup he tried to find out who was behind it
 i picked up one of the telephones i have and it wasnt working
i picked up a second a third a fourth 
everything was cut off he said
 every day morning and night i demanded 
that my communication be restored and that an airplane be brought immediately so i could be returned to moscow he said
he was being held at his vacation home in the crimea
 gorbachev said the coup leaders demanded that he resign
 i said you will never live that long to see me resign
 he called the crisis one of the most difficult trials of the entire history of his sixyear rule
 gorbachev said his man personal guard stayed with him throughout the coup
 the yearold president said the crisis had been difficult for his family especially his wife raisa who took it very hard
 best of all my granddaughter anastasia didnt understand anything that was going on gorbachev told reporters
she wanted to go to the beach thats all that concerned her
but the guards wouldnt let her go to the beach they were concerned something would happen
 when it became clear the coup was failing gorbachev said he prepared himself and his family for the possibility that they would be killed by the conspirators
 you know that it appeared as though they might have done something to me
they might have killed me and my whole family and made it look as if 
they were acting in the name of the acting president
 these people might have done almost anything he said
hurricane gilberts growth from a harmless low pressure zone off africa to a ferocious killer in the gulf of mexico was fueled by a combination of heat moisture and wind that baffles forecasters
its a matter of getting everything together in the right place in the right time gil clark of the national hurricane center said thursday
it doesnt happen very often
how it develops we dont know
gilbert came to the attention of center forecasters sept  as a dry low pressure trough moving west out of africa
we get  or  of these off africa every summer
about one of six develop said clark
by sept  the system became a depression
it reached tropical storm status by saturday and a hurricane sunday
a tropical wave becomes a depression when winds start swirling
when sustained winds reach  mph the system becomes a named tropical storm
it reaches hurricane status when sustained winds hit  mph
why gilbert organized and strengthened while other systems didnt is a mystery more or less said university of miami meteorology professor rainer bleck
the first part of the summer we were biting our nails wondering why these other disturbances didnt develop he said thursday
thats something meteorologists would like to know more about
but the scientists do know what fuels a budding storm once development begins
and they know that development is sparked when winds converge and that growth is affected by time and place
if that happens in an area where theres plenty of moisture in the lower atmosphere the bottom  feet or so this convergence may lead to upward motion and cloud formation bleck said
if clouds form the heat of condensation in the clouds occasionally provides positive feedback to the convergence pattern
that strengthens it he said adding that storms can begin budding only off the equator because of the earths rotation
eventually a vortex is created
any time you contract an air mass they will start spinning
thats what makes the tornadoes hurricanes and blizzards those winter storms bleck said
hurricanes are useful to the climate machine
their primary role is to transport heat from the lower to the upper atmosphere he said
the sun puts energy into the water the top of the oceans and lowest part of the atmosphere
that has to be distributed from the bottom to higher levels of the atmosphere
when the depression that would become gilbert neared barbados warm atlantic waters nurtured it
this time of year in the northwest caribbean is best for development clark said
if you get a storm in this area in september when the waters warmest it can just explode
this is where camille formed and exploded referring to the  storm that slammed into the gulf coast
it is an exciting thing to watch
if youre on the beach watching the storm surge its a different story he said
the hurricane center said gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure measured at  inches tuesday night
that broke the  inches of the  hurricane that devastated the florida keys
west german officials and media today praised soviet president mikhail s gorbachev for softening his view on german reunification and said it could give hope to disheartened east germans
disgraced former communist party leader erich honecker was released from prison tuesday night after justice officials determined he was too frail to withstand the rigors of imprisonment while awaiting trial on treason charges
gorbachev said tuesday in moscow that he believed one germany was likely in the future but he added that germans should not decide this important question on the streets
he referred to the growing number of demonstrations in east germany in support of reunification
gorbachevs statement was his most tolerant yet on the subject of a single germany which has been opposed by communists for more than  years
east german communists on tuesday endorsed for reunification for the first time
in west germany foreign minister hansdietrich genscher told west german radio that gorbachev had correctly analyzed the situation and again shown his political skill
west german officials and media praised gorbachevs view as realistic and described it as an important sign of hope for east germans who have lost faith in their government
communist leaders launched their uphill campaign for march  parliamentary elections with a news conference to unveil their european concept that aims for a united and demilitarized europe
party ideologist peter brie said the communists support the togetherness of the german nation and urged a thoughtful and measured approach to reunification
in an interview with the west german bild newspaper party leader gregor gysi complained that the reunification drive is moving too quickly
asked if the communists oppose reunification gysi told the newspaper no not at all
this process cannot be stopped any more
but it is irresponsible to do things in such a way now as if it were possible tomorrow
the reunification issue promises to dominate the election campaign that will seat a new leadership in less than seven weeks
increasing numbers of east germans have demonstrated for union with wealthy and prosperous west germany as their own economy tumbles and an exodus of skilled workers continues unchecked
more than  people fled east germany last year having lost hope that their spartan living conditions would improve
the devastating flight has included as many as  people daily since jan 
the communists are widely distrusted because of corruption scandals that have surfaced since the peaceful prodemocracy revolt last fall and because they carry the blame for leading east germany into its current economic and political crises
the man most blamed for the countrys problems honecker was set free after an east berlin court rejected a request that he be kept in prison until his trial in march
he was jailed monday
the court decided that despite the severity of the charges against honecker the state of the accuseds health does not permit imprisonment the official adn news agency reported
a spokesman for chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph promised that the investigation against honecker would proceed
adn said the court acted on advice from two doctors who examined honecker independently
honecker  underwent surgery on jan  to remove a malignant kidney tumor
honecker was ousted from the leadership on oct  after massive prodemocracy demonstrations
he was expelled from the communist party in december and has since been accused of treason and abusing his power
as a military coup attempt unfolded in their homeland  miles away supporters of the rebellious soldiers engaged in a shouting match thursday night with supporters of president corazon aquino at the philippine consulate in los angeles
about  members of the filipinoamerican movement for a better philippines held a candlelight vigil outside the consulate on wilshire boulevard to express sympathy with the coup led by officers linked to renegade lt col gregorio honasan
we are calling for mrs aquino to step down immediately said milo castelo  a los angeles attorney
he said the aquino government is inept and incompetent and guilty of rampant corruption
castelo and a handful of the protesters then entered the office building and took the elevator to the thfloor consulate where a coalition of four filipino groups in los angeles that support the aquino government had just completed a press conference
half a dozen television news crews watched as the antigovernment protesters confronted the acting consul general for the philippines in los angeles willy c gaa
we are in sympathy with the coup in the philippines
announced eli swing  a los angeles real estate agent
the consul general remained silent glaring at the protesters
but danny lamila a representative of the philippines liberal party loudly defended the government
these people staging the coup are criminals lamila yelled
they are fugitives from justice
after a few minutes the  aquino supporters in the room began chanting cory
cory
the antigovernment protesters then left the consular offices and order was restored
greg santillas of the campaign for democracy and independence said he believes that most of the estimated  filipinos living in los angeles county oppose the military coup
were here not only to support the president but also the democratic institutions he said
the military is a dangerous leftover from the dictatorship of ferdinand marcos
we dont want the government to be a hostage to the military
also present at the press conference was andrea aquino  the niece of assassinated marcos opponent benigno aquino cory aquinos husband
i support democracy and the government against the coup she said
i think its about time these renegades are punished
residents took forecasters at their word when they warned of hurricane hugos fury and the low number of deaths from the powerful storm can be credited to this healthy respect authorities said
the storm which caused billions in damage claimed  lives in south carolina and only two were in the charleston area which bore the brunt of hugos  mph winds
we just feel very thankful about that said mayor joseph p riley jr several thousands of people who were in the shelters and the tens of thousands of people who evacuated inland were potential victims of injury and death
riley and other officials credited residents with monitoring the hurricane as it spun toward charleston and heeding evacuation warnings
the last big storm to hit south carolina was hurricane david in  which hit the coast after pounding southern florida
since then several big storms have threatened but veered away and officials were worried that charlestonians wouldnt heed hugos warnings
weve had so many close calls said gary garnet a meteorologist with the national weather service
but this storm was very very strong he said
this time they realized it
glen ellis a red cross official estimated that  residents in charleston and the three surrounding counties headed for shelters
tens of thousands more got into their cars and headed up interstate  toward columbia
mayor john bourne of north charleston where there apparently were no stormrelated deaths credited people for heeding the warnings
it was bad but it could have been a lot worse he said
youve just got to say nice things about the people
meanwhile garnet had some good news for stormweary charlestonians late saturday the tropics were quiet with no other storms brewing
theres nothing to worry about out there he said
checkpoint charlie the famed allied border crossing by the berlin wall was to be hauled away friday
us army sgt
lorn walsh late thursday stood sentry for the last time by the little white shack rendered unnecessary by the thaw in eastwest relations
this is a nice way to end my military service  to be here when they take it down said walsh  a military police officer who leaves the army in six weeks to study for the priesthood
a huge crane hung over the small house in the middle of the narrow street that leads to east berlin where a sign in english german russian and french says you are now leaving the american sector
secretary of state james a baker iii soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and their colleagues from france britain and the two germanys were to preside over a ceremony marking the checkpoints removal friday
the envoys from the german states and the four world war ii allies that divided them were in east berlin to discuss the international aspects of german unification
since east germany overthrew its communist government last fall and the german borders were opened checkpoint charlie has become as superfluous as the crumbling berlin wall
with huge sections of the berlin wall being ripped down daily us officials decided two weeks ago to remove checkpoint charlie
the border crossing was the scene of stirring escapes and heartbreaking captures as east germans tried flee to the west breaking through east german control stations just  yards away from the allied checkpoint
east germans once manned their side of the checkpoint with emotionless effiency closely scrutinizing travel documents and creating a palpable tension
thursday night they merely waved westerners through their side of the checkpoint although some tourists demanded their documents be checked
a deepsea inspection of the bismarck suggests that the most powerful battleship in adolf hitlers navy was scuttled by its own crew rather than sunk by the british in a celebrated battle underwater explorer robert d ballard said thursday
during a minute news conference ballard described how he his oceancrawling robot located the bismarck sitting upright and proud two weeks ago
then the american oceanographer whose father was of british background and whose mother was of german heritage addressed himself to the german people in german
i am an underwater explorer not a treasure hunter he said translating himself back into english
we found no human remains
we touched nothing and took nothing
the future of the bismarck is in the hands of the german people
he said he will disclose its exact location only to germany so germans themselves can decide whether to try to raise the ship which sank after a battle may  
ballard a senior scientist at the woods hole oceanographic institution in massachusetts said structural evidence satisfied him that the germans scuttled the battleship rather than trying to surrender or allowing her to be sent down by british fire
only scuttled ships tend to make it to the bottom in one piece ballard said
it appears the crew opened it up along its entire length
it was clearly flooded stem to stern
maybe the germans didnt want it taken as a war prize he added
it is known that two years earlier hitler ordered the german pocket battleship graf spee scuttled after it was cornered in the neutral port of montevideo uruguay and attacked by british ships
hitler apparently wanted to keep the british from learning the secrets of the graf spees construction and weapons
in the  battle the bismarcks main guns were quickly knocked out and the attacking british ships were out of range of her secondary guns ballard said so its was helpless and taking hundreds of hits  its sinking clearly inevitable
rendered unsteerable by torpedoes dropped by tiny fabriccovered british biplanes it was unable to escape
asked if the german commander couldnt have surrendered by ceasing fire ballard said in the fuzz of battle in fierce seas it would have been unlikely that the british would have recognized that the germans were giving up
again he speculated perhaps the germans did not want the ships technologically advanced equipment to fall into british hands
the bismarck was found by ballard in more than  feet of water about  miles west of brest france
he said it was in remarkably good shape elegant well preserved
before the battle british prime minister winston churchill had left convoys unprotected and thrown all his capital ships in pursuit with a ringing threeword command sink the bismarck
of the bismarcks man crew only about  survived
british ships picked up  survivors but left with hundreds of german sailors still in the icy waters after spotting what might have been a german uboat
german vessels later rescued only five more survivors
the story has been recounted in books songs and a movie
the sinking occurred only eight days after the bismarck left gdynia poland for her first operation
if unstopped it could have posed a critical threat to convoys of merchant shipping and undercut british morale at a time when england stood virtually alone against combined german sea and air power
the british sent the warship hood after the bismarck but within five days of going to sea the bismarck had sunk the hood in a threeminute engagement with the loss of all but three of the vessels crew of 
the hood was a symbol of british sea power and its loss stunned the british public and the war government and made sinking the bismarck a mission of crucial importance
ballard said under laws of the sea the bismarck remains the property of the german people
the sunken battleship was discovered and photographed by the same remotecontrolled robot that ballard used four years ago to find the wreck of the titanic the british passenger liner that sank in  after striking an iceberg
historians say the world need not fear that german jackboots will echo again on european pavements but some still see the rush toward german reunification as a setback  a step away from the integration of europe
for the most part the historians say an east germany collapsing into chaos represents a greater threat to stability than a united german state
the west germans are moving ahead not out of nationalistic fervor but a perceived need to deal with a crisis said henry ashby turner of yale author of the two germanies since 
there is no such a thing as indelible national character turner said
i dont think there is any chance that the young men of germany are going to slip out of their adidas running shoes and pull on jackboots and start running around saying heil
he was one of several experts in german history discussing the implications of reunification following the decision tuesday by the four world war ii allies  the united states britain france and the soviet union  to accept the reunification of a germany they divided  years ago
university of chicago historian michael geyer a native of germany said he feared the creation of a strong sovereign nation in the center of europe could reverse a more important development  the year drive toward an integrated europe in which industries banks trade unions and even government ministries have been collaborating across borders
the east german state is collapsing said geyer
so something has to happen very dramatically
but they have a choice  the europeans and germans and americans
do they want to opt for the european card or for the german card
i think they are opting for the german card
i hear these days very little about what gorbachev called the house of europe he said
the result of a dominant uncomfortably strong german state geyer added could be a setback to the diminishment of national borders
it could also mean he said that american troops might have to stay in europe as a counterweight to germany
if i had my druthers reunifications would have happened after  after the integration of the west german economy into the economy of western europe said charles j herber of george washington university expressing similar concern
then there would have been fewer chances for german adventurers he said
west germans were aware of their european neighbors misgivings said richard breitman of american university and so they presented reunification within the context of european integration
they wanted to avoid arousing fear of a united germany again dominating europe
even if the history did not exist there would be fears of that kind he said
were dealing not just with rational calculation but a whole host of emotional memories
for all that breitman said one germany is not only inevitable but given the successful record of west germany over the last  years my feeling is it is better than having a regime in chaos
the only alternative to reunification added turner is an east germany in ruins a basket case a bangladesh of europe
he said germans have no significant interest in territorial revisions
those misgivings are misplaced
gerhard weinberg of the university of north carolina considered a leading historian of the nazi era cautioned that reunification if mishandled could prove explosive
while the people of west europe have gotten over nationalistic distrusts east europeans living in closed societies have not he said and fear of germany is a reality in east europe and russia he said
i dont think the germans are heading for moscow again but we have to give people  and the germans have to give people  time to think this through and get used to it
mishandled reunification could scare one or the other of the participants into starting something and scare others and goodness knows where it would end
gordon craig emeritus professor at stanford said the division of germany has been the basis of a peace settlement which worked pretty well but was abnormal and sooner or later had to be corrected
german reunification said craig gives the world the chance to build a new international system one that will prevent the use of international violence
he added we have to be careful that we dont fall back into the kind of system that existed before the second world war a europe filled with nations that were suffering various grievances rivalries disputed frontiers driven by what they considered to be legitimate reasons but pitted against each other  the sort of things that gave rise to hitler in 
troops battled mobs of moslem separatists in the kashmir city of srinagar over the weekend and at least  people were killed and  wounded before the fighting subsided sunday night police said
fifteen demonstrators were shot and killed sunday while six were fatally wounded late saturday night according to mohammad nomani inspector general of srinagar police
militants defied a curfew and continued trading intermittent shots with government forces on sunday officials said
witnesses speaking on condition of anonymity said the death toll was at least  but that figure could not be confirmed
nomani speaking by telephone from srinagar the summer capital of jammukashmir state said the fighting tapered off late sunday afternoon as heavy rains lashed the city
but gunfire echoed through the deserted streets until evening one resident said requesting anonymity
they the troops are shooting at anything moving he said
it is a disastrous situation out there said ramesh kaul a hotel receptionist in srinagar
at least  people have been killed in jammukashmir state since the beginning of the year in violence triggered by moslem militants demanding independence or union with islamic pakistan
the separatists led by the jammukashmir liberation front have often attacked government offices and police officials
the situation is tense and dangerous the states chief secretary moosa raza said in jammu the states winter capital  miles south of srinagar
nomani said the police dispatched  cars with loudspeakers into the city to appeal to people to obey the curfew
the cars were escorted by heavily armed troops from the paramilitary central reserve police force he said
a hour curfew was imposed saturday in a bid to quell escalating violence and mass antiindia demonstrations in srinagar and nearby towns
but late saturday crowds defied curfew and surged into downtown srinagar chanting indian dogs go back
and long live pakistan
local reporters said
they said the paramilitary troops opened fire killing two people instantly and injuring 
four of them died later
as news of the shootings spread thousands of moslem men poured out of their homes the reporters said
they said protesters recited verses from the koran the moslem holy book
some took up a chant urging mujahedeen or islamic holy warriors to prepare for the final sacrifice in a showdown with indias hindudominated government
jammukashmirs former state chief minister farooq abdullah issued a statement accusing authorities of letting loose a reign of terror and repression
abdullahs moslemdominated national conference party is closely aligned with the congress party of rajiv gandhi the arch political foe of prime minister vp

abdullahs government resigned friday to protest the appointment of singhs nominee as the states new governor and imposition of governors rule which amounts to tighter federal control over the state
the curfew order was one of the first acts of the new governor jagmohan a tough administrator who had cracked down on kashmiri militants during an earlier stint as the states governor
jagmohan a hindu who uses one name took office friday
parts of kashmir region are claimed by both india and pakistan
the dispute started when the state was partitioned between the two countries when they gained independence from britain in 
srinagars  people are moslty moslem as is a majority of population in the kashmir region
the jammu region is predominantly hindu
india has often accused pakistan of aiding the kashmiri militants a charge pakistan has denied

a man fired several dozen shots from an automatic rifle in an elementary school tuesday killing six children wounding at least  other people and then shooting himself in the head authorities said
we have at least one suspect in custody who has a gunshot wound to the head deputy police chief ralph tribble said
bruce fernandez spokesman for the county office of emergency services said six people had died
ellen rich at st josephs medical center said eight victims were being treated there and said the total including those being treated at other hospitals was  wounded
we have at least  people that weve sent out to area hospitals said police chief jack calkins
the attack at cleveland elementary school came shortly before noon

several dozen shots were heard from an automatic rifle said monk
john g tower has fallen but the sky has not
for all the forecasts of dire results if the senate blocked towers path to the pentagon business is proceeding as usual
president bush said the case was closed and accepted democratic assurances of future cooperation
that doesnt undo the resentment among some of towers more ardent republican allies in the senate and in some corners of the white house
bush lieutenants claimed they had heard what sounded like assurances of support from a dozen senate democrats
they ended up with only three democrats in the closetopartyline vote against tower
nevertheless a week after the former texas senator was denied confirmation as secretary of defens the waters have closed
there will be ripples and some of them could be wavesized
the goodbehavior rules set in the debate over towers drinking habits and his lucrative defense consulting business are certain to be invoked as precedents whenever republicans spot a democratic target
weve established what will be known as the tower standards said sen john warner rva that argument will be used by house republicans challenging the financial conduct of house speaker jim wright
but it will be a debating point not a turning point in a wright controversy that was ordained long before the tower episode
while president bush was unwavering in his support of tower he burned no bridges to congressional democrats
he insisted that tower was the best man for the job and he spoke out repeatedly for his choice even after it was clear that the nomination was doomed
but he didnt get nasty about it saying there was no point in escalating the fight
thats over he said  hours after the tower defeat
thats history
and now we are going to go forward
the  vote against tower was a setback to bush in the sense that it always is a defeat when congress denies a president something he wants
but this denial did not cost bush a program or a major campaign pledge or the support of voters
indeed it could turn out that the senate did the president a favor by sending tower back to texas instead of to the pentagon
it was a break bush could not make with a political ally who had been after the pentagon job since ronald reagan was elected president
tower had not been a reagan man  he had supported bush for the  nomination
and the reagan white house went to some lengths to rule the senator out of the job he sought declaring that the new president would not be nominating any senate republican for any cabinet post
after towers long wait bush displayed his own loyalty all the way to a losing vote when the standard somewhat safer course would have been to withdraw the nominee
tower not only shunned withdrawal he offered conditions that had to be humiliating if only the senate would let him have the job
tower promised to quit drinking taking the pledge on national television
and when that didnt work he offered to become the firstever probationary cabinet member
republicans proposed that he get the job for a sixmonth trial and then return for reconfirmation a gimmick that would have changed the system and could have haunted the presidency
no deal
so tower became the ninth cabinet nominee ever to be rejected the first who was a former senator
bush said he had been fighting for the right of a president to appoint his own cabinet but he avoided language that would have raised the political stakes
tower did not restrain himself
battling for the job he said withdrawal would damage bush and rejection would be damning the presidents judgment
he said his nomination had been turned into a vehicle for a major presidential defeat
towers advocates on the senate floor said grave constitutional issues were at stake that the authority of the presidency was on the line that the senate will come to rue the rules it wrote in the tower decision
but bush said all along that the outcome either way would not hurt on other issues
sen sam nunn chairman of the armed services committee and the pivotal figure in the tower defeat agreed
he told his georgia constituents that the tower rejection would not hurt bushs leadership
in washington triumphs and setbacks are shortlived nunn said and thats particularly true of the president

it may be tomorrow before we have a final count he said
the governor said  national guard troops were dispatched to the city along with search and rescue equipment
witnesses said the downtown jones valley elementary school the waterford square and adjacent queensbury apartment complexes were reduced to rubble by the tornado

the fifth death was reported near the shopping district
weve called in troopers from around the state to help kelly said
the city is home to marshall space flight center and the armys redstone arsenal but no serious damage was reported from the space agency or weapons testing center
telephone communication and electricity were disrupted by the tornadoes and waaytv the only station still broadcasting reported widespread damage
it came in with a huge roar an enormous amount of water and it just started shaking and tearing at everything it could get hold of said real estate broker ike carroll who was in his car when the twister struck
it started picking cars up and pushing them around 
some of them upside down some of them just strewn around he said
heavy overhead power lines started snapping just like a circus performer would snap his whip carroll said
all of these heavy arcing flashing lines that were just popping and snapping over the top of us 
it was as if you were looking into an arcwelder they were so bright he said
waay reported at least one person died when the roof of a business collapsed from winds that overturned cars in the area
a nearby shopping center also was damaged

iran said today that it would welcome relief offered by its bitter enemy the united states to help victims of the earthquake that has killed as many as  people the state department said in washington
the aid would be accepted through the american red cross and other us humanitarian organizations deputy spokesman richard boucher said
we want to be helpful without regard for our political differences with iran he said
there have been only rare instances of usiranian cooperation since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago
the united states holds iran partly responsible for the continued detention of american hostages by proiranian groups in lebanon
boucher said iran told the us government that private donor agencies should contact the iranian red crescent a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance
the us government routinely channels humanitarian assistance through the red cross and other donor groups
boucher said the iranian message to the united states presumably was delivered through a third party but added that he was uncertain
messages between the two countries normally are handled by the swiss embassy in tehran
iranian authorities have told united nations officials that about  people died in the earthquake
iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries  including iraq  but excluded israel and south africa
rescuers in iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by the earthquake in northern iran which struck early thursday and had a magnitude between  and 
the islamic republic news agency said  people were pulled from rubble and airlifted from the stricken gilan and zanjan provinces to hospitals
iranian television showed scenes of devastation including the remains of an entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill
rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims
they gently fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth only his head protruding
the iranian red crescent asked for help in providing shelter for  people left homeless by the earthquake
offers of help came from across the globe
the death toll was higher than a quake that killed  people in nearby soviet armenia in december  and a quake in iran in  that also killed 
in scenes shown on television masked rescuers in white aprons pulled dustcovered bodies from under concrete slabs
corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open trucks
the staterun television interviewed one middleaged man from roodbar a mountainside village in gilan province who said he was sleeping when the temblor struck
it was so strong he said
i was thrown several meters i ended up by the olive trees outside his home
then a big boulder hit the house
the house collapsed
i lost all four of my children

joseph b gildenhorn the lawyer and real estate developer named by president bush as us ambassador to switzerland and his immediate family gave nearly  to republican campaigns since  disclosure statements show
gildenhorn according to senate sources is one of several bush ambassadorial nominees who have been rated unqualified by the american academy of diplomacy an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats including all living former secretaries of state
one of a lengthy and growing list of bush supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts gildenhorn gave  during the  presidential campaign to the republican national state elections committee
the gift was not subject to the disclosure requirements of the federal election campaign act
the  contributions made between  and early this year by gildenhorn and members of his immediate family are being used by senate democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many gop contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for foreign service professionals
gildenhorn said friday he could not comment because he is in a confirmation process
a report prepared by the state department for the foreign relations committee said gildenhorn would make an excellent candidate for an ambassadorship because of his solid background in law and management
it also cited another qualification
mr gildenhorn has been a strong republican supporter being a member of the eagles and team  the state department said
the republican eagles are contributors of  or more in a single year to the republican national committee while team  designates people who have donated  or more
gildenhorns political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the senate foreign relations committee which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week
they totaled  in   in   in   in   in  and  this year
the total 
additionally his wife alma lee gave  over the six years including  in  his daughter carolyn gave  his son michael gave  and his father oscar gildenhorn gave 
that brings the total contributions made by gildenhorn and his family to the gop to  since 
gildenhorn gave  during the period to the republican national committee or to the republican eagles
he gave  in  and  in  to the fund for the american future a bush political action committee and contributed the legal limit of  to the bush campaign in 
gildenhorn also gave thousands of dollars to republican congressional candidates
included were gifts to the campaigns of sens
rudy boschwitz rminn bill cohen rmaine pete domenici rnm arlen specter rpa john warner rva orrin hatch rutah bob kasten rwis and former sen paula hawkins rfla gildenhorn  is a senior partner in brown gildenhorn and jacobs a law firm specializing in real estate
he is also president of the jbg real estate associates and jbg properties inc gildenhorn is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the sovran bank here
he is a graduate of the university of maryland and yale university law school
other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the american academy of diplomacy include florida real estate developer joseph zappala nominated as ambassador to spain melvin l sembler a real estate executive in florida named to be ambassador to australia and della m newman a seattle wash real estate broker named to be ambassador to new zealand
no action has been taken by the senate on any of those nominations
according to sen paul sarbanes dmd who first raised the issue of political contributions zappala and sembler each contributed more than  to republican candidates and causes
mrs newman served as chairman of the washington state bush for president committee
ambassador david popper president of the academy of diplomacy declined to confirm that gildenhorn and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors
but he said the academy does offer such ratings making its judgments based on a comparison of the nominees biography and the requirements of the job
he said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the united states abroad with dignity respect and ability
twenty of  ambassadorial nomination made by bush in the first six months of his administration have gone to nonprofessionals many of them large contributors to republican causes committee sources said
sarbanes says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps with amateurs rewarded for purely political services
political throwaways sarbanes calls them
i think the time has come very frankly to get off the money merrygoround and ask some very difficult questions essentially about when extensive political contributions are going to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination sarbanes told the committee last month
its not true in every instance but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the  mark in order to make the consideration list sarbanes said
sarbanes says he is not against political ambassadors as such noting that many of them compiled distinguished records
it is not the political ambassadors that are the problem sarbanes said
it is ambassadors without qualifications
the oscar statuette one of the most recognizable images in the entertainment world has no copyright protection a federal judge has ruled
the small academy award statue is part of the public domain us district court judge laughlin waters said in a ruling released thursday
the decision was a setback for the academy of motion picture arts and sciences which had sued a chicagobased manufacturer of an employeeincentive trophy similar to the oscar
academy president karl malden said the ruling comes as a shock to me
the academy said it would appeal
the academy claimed that the star award the trophy lookalike made by creative house promotions violated copyright laws diluted the academys trademark and represented unfair competition
the star award depicted a naked muscular male much like the oscar just two inches shorter and holding a star instead of a sword
it had a gold finish similar to the oscar and stood on a circular gold cap mounted on a cylindrical base
although waters acknowledged that the creative house trophy is very similar to the oscar he rejected all of the academys legal claims saying that the statuette became part of the public domain prior to jan   the effective date of the copyright act of 
the film industrys top award was distributed from the first ceremony in  until about  without the c mark indicating a copyright
the judge ruled too that the oscar not only was an honorary award but also was used to promote the film industry and therefore did not have a limited purpose as required by the copyright act
the academy noted that the ruling applied only to the statuette and that the academys trademark and service marks for the oscar and the academy award names and symbols are unaffected
we are surprised that the court would base its decision on events which occurred half a century ago overlooking the meticulous fashion in which the academy has protected the integrity of its institutional symbol for decades malden said in a statement
children whose families escaped the horrors of the vietnam war saw their schoolyard turned into a killing field the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and a pistol bearing the word victory
after the massacre at recess the bodies of three southeast asian children were outlined in blue on the playground of cleveland elementary school where they died
two others had been dragged by teachers inside to a classroom but also died
twentynine other pupils were wounded along with a teacher
there was shooting all over
i was scared said sixthgrader binh hoang who was born in vietnam in  in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire
everybody was crying in my class
police said a drifter identified as patrick edward purdy  armed with two handguns and an ak assault rifle entered the school grounds around noontime tuesday and fired about  rounds before he shot himself to death
afterward a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the ground near a pool of blood and the gunmans body
the word victory was written on the pistol handle
binh said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began outside the woodandstucco school building
her teacher told students to get under their desks
the gunfire startled michael cuevas whose first thought was that the university of the pacific fraternities near his house were firing their miniature cannon again
but the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon and the scream of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank
i never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in stockton said cuevas a yearold marine clerk at the port of stockton who lives down the street from the elementary school
its always in some other town some other place
its a shock to my senses
i dont think its even hit me as hard as its going to
you dont know whether to be excited or confused or what
police cars and news reporters crowded the street which typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their children
said jeff russell  who was born and reared in the neighborhood
this has always been a sleepy little town
the shooting put us back on the map
lutheran and baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood of ranchstyle homes postagestamp lawns and streets lined with sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of  people  miles southeast of san francisco
the yearold neighborhood near the university of the pacific is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes there
but the city has been changing with the influx of southeast asian refugees
when school officials called clergy to console grieving families buddhist priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with their whitecollared christian counterparts
about  percent of cleveland elementarys students are of southeast asian descent said john klose spokesman for the stockton school district
the five children who were killed were vietnamese and cambodian
this is one of our best neighborhood schools klose said
of all of our schools that i would think of something like this happening this would be the last one i would think of
across the street sarah abbott stood astride her bicycle and gazed at the school where she graduated many years ago
the professional nanny said she was at the house of her yearold grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his car on fire before starting to shoot
when the car exploded my grandpas house just shook abbott said
it scared me
it was just too close
a huge cloud of ashladen steam rose up to  feet above the volcano today spreading ash over a sixmile radius the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said
 if it does erupt the deadly hot ash produced by the volcano could sweep across adjoining clark air base he said
also in peril are the  residents of angeles city where the air base is located about  miles north of manila
 even if the volcano does not erupt the threat of eruption is likely to keep the base closed for weeks at least lipman said
 scientists doubt its more than coincidence that the eruption is occurring at the same time as the mount unzen volcano in japan he said
 the five usgs scientists are among the few remaining people at clark air base which was evacuated along with thousands of filipinos living near the volcano
 the researchers along with  filipino scientists and their equipment today moved to a bunker on the east edge of the air base  miles from the volcano where they should be safe from ash avalanches
 mount pinatubo is typical of hundreds of volcanoes that make up the ring of fire on the pacific coasts of asia and the americas
these volcanoes  including mount lassen in shasta county and mount rainier and mount st helens in washington all in the cascade range  arise where one of the earths immense crust plates is slowly diving beneath another
 pinatubos last eruption  years ago is thought to have yielded at least as much molten rock  half a cubic kilometer  as mount st helens did when it erupted in 
until volcanologists attention was drawn to it by a cluster of earthquakes beneath the volcano this spring it had not been studied well
 other recent volcanoes that erupted on the same scale were el chichon in mexico in  and nevado del ruiz in colombia in  if it does have a massive eruption pinatubos primary means of causing death and destruction would be hellish avalanches of hot ash   degrees or more flowing and billowing at up to  mph engulfing and searing all in their path
 in the worst case a really big eruption all of clark air force base could be covered with glowing ash lipman said
 just being caught in a cloud of ash blowing off the avalanche is fatal
that is what killed  people in japan last week
 such ash also would wreak havoc with the engines of planes at the air base lipman said
 planes flying through clouds of volcanic ash  indistinguishable on radar from rain clouds  run the risk of having their engines stalled by the grit
 so far the winds have blown ash away from the base
but winds of the summer monsoon weather pattern expected to begin any day would send ash directly toward the base
 the volcanos activity  measured by seismometers detecting slight earthquakes in its molten rock plumbing system  is increasing in a way that suggests a large eruption is imminent lipman said
 the scientists also are monitoring tiltmeters on the volcanos slopes to watch it swell as magma builds inside
on clear days they fly above the crater to measure sulfur emissions
 their predictions might be a false alarm  the volcano may have done its worst already
but it would take several weeks of declining quakes and sulfur emissions before scientists would be reasonably confident that the military could return to the base
 volcanologists know of no reason the volcanos activity could be linked to the volcano in japan which is of comparable size
 no reputable scientist i know of is drawing a connection between the two lipman said
 more than  volcanoes have erupted in historical time he noted
two out of  is no big deal
investigators have said maxwell siphoned money from his companies in a desperate attempt to deal with his empires crushing debts
they also have said some questionable transactions may have occurred after maxwells death
 in an interview published today by the daily mirror robert maxwells london flagship newspaper kevin maxwell was quoted as saying of the pensioners i am desperately sorry for them
but i have to be honest
the debts are so enormous that when everything is sorted out there will be nothing left
 one week ago the serious fraud office a government prosecution agency began investigating mirror group newspapers plcs pension fund assets and related matters
the company says about  million was taken from its pension fund without authority
 kevin maxwell spoke with the daily mirror as he flew to new york on tuesday for talks on the future of the daily news which his father bought in march
kevin maxwell is now the publisher
 in a report today the washington post quoted unidentified sources as saying robert maxwell never created the pension fund for daily news managers he promised to start with funding from tribune co which sold the paper to maxwell
pension money accumulated before the sale wasnt affected it said
 revelations of maxwells financial manipulations have led to numerous newspaper characterizations of him as a crook
 i have to say to myself that given the sequence of events and looking at the whole picture that a lot of it is fair comment kevin maxwell was quoted as saying by the daily mirror
 asked how he thought his father died he was quoted as saying suicide
not the remotest possibility
 maxwells body was found in the sea off the canary islands on nov 
he had been cruising on his yacht
preliminary findings by spanish pathologists indicated he could have fallen into the sea after a heart attack
 kevin maxwell has been linked to transactions of a pension fund management firm at the center of the controversy over the missing money investigators say
he and brother ian are under court order to disclose by next week what they know about the affairs of bishopsgate investment management ltd one of about  companies controlled by their father
 in another development the financial times said today that documents show creditors face losses of at least  million on loans to robert maxwells private companies
kuwaiti and iraqi negotiators embraced warmly tuesday as they began talks on their oil and border dispute sources said
diplomats reported that iraq had massed  troops on kuwaits border
gulfbased diplomatic sources said the iraqi force triple the number earlier reported included about  sovietmade tanks and dwarfed the entire kuwaiti army of  troops
the diplomats who spoke on condition of anonymity said the troops have been concentrated along the border since last week when iraq began threatening kuwait
iraq accused the small persian gulf state of stealing oil from a disputed border region and forcing oil prices to drop
the diplomats said the number of troops was at first difficult to determine
the delegation leaders crown prince and prime minister sheik saad alabdullah alsabah of kuwait and izzat ibrahim deputy chairman of iraqs revolutionary command council met privately for two hours
there were no details on the negotiations but sources said the meetings will continue wednesday
diplomatic sources have said they expect arab mediators to push the two sides to sign a treaty of nonbelligerency to be followed by protracted negotiations on borders and compensation
the iraqkuwait crisis broke out on july  when iraqi president saddam hussein accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of driving down oil prices by exceeding quotas set for them by the organization of petroleum exporting countries
saddam said the move cost iraq  billion in lost revenue
saddam also demanded compensation for the  billion in oil he claimed kuwait pumped illegally from an oil field which straddles the unmarked border between the two countries
iraq also demanded that kuwait forgive  billion in loans it extended to baghdad during the eightyear iraniraq war
iraqs tough talk appeared to have succeeded
kuwait and the uae agreed to stick to their oil quotas at an opec meeting last week
opec member states also agreed to a longstanding iraqi demand to raised target crude oil prices from  to  a barrel
kuwaiti and iraqi officials agreed to meet in jiddah after intensive mediation efforts by king fahd and egyptian president hosni mubarak
kuwaiti leaders had insisted that iraq pull back its troops before conciliation talks could began but later dropped that demand
kuwaiti officials also asked that iraq agree to demarcate the disputed border between the nations a move iraq has refused
iraq has historically laid claim to all of kuwait and has long coveted the kuwaiti islands of bubiyan and warba which command access to iraqs sole outlet into the persian gulf
the mediators have succeeded in toning down a vitriolic campaign against kuwait by the iraqi staterun media
on tuesday the iraqi delegation left baghdad without any public announcement
the leading althawra daily newspaper called the jiddah meeting an opportunity  for kuwait  to perceive iraqs demands and respond to its rights
in contrast the kuwaiti delegation left for jiddah with fanfare and publicity
the kuwaiti papers said they hoped the jiddah meeting was the start of a final just settlement of the differences between iraq and kuwait in a manner ensuring the legitimate rights of each
the berlin villa where the nazi leadership met to implement the final solution against europes jewish population will be the site of a world jewish congress conference on german reunification
the new yorkbased organization announced tuesday that the meeting is scheduled for may  the th anniversary of ve day
the world is expecting a jewish statement on reunification said edgar bronfman the president of the world jewish congress
i think that the place where they decided on the final solution is the right place to have such a meeting and the anniversary of the victory in europe seems to be the right day
some  members of the world jewish congress from about  countries will attend the conference at the villa in wannsee berlin where on jan   high german government and party officials adopted a plan to exterminate the jews
jews have a right to state a moral position on german reunification and we will make a moral statement
and part of that moral statement is to see that it the holocaust doesnt happen again bronfman said
in the long run he said a united germany can be a very positive thing for europe but certain precautions must be taken to prevent a repeat of history
for example germanys borders must be sealed in cement and the country should not be allowed nuclear weapons he said
bronfman said he does not fear a resurgence of antisemitism once the two germanys are united
in fact he said reunification might cause a decline in antijewish feelings
now that reunification is about to be a fact they wont be blaming the jews for a divided germany bronfman explained
the conference will convene may  and a formal declaration on german reunification will be issued may 
it will be the first meeting ever held on german soil by the world jewish congress which was founded in  in response to hitlers threats against jews

in local government elections across britain yesterday the conservatives suffered their worst defeat ever losing control of  regional councils and  seats
as the ruling party the tories took just  percent of the vote two percentage points lower than their rating in the polls
the results of the local elections showed that the tories were reduced to the third party nationally behind the liberal democrats and the labour party
the labour party controls  local councils whereas the conservatives only control  with a sharp contrast in strength between the two sides
the liberal democrats had a net gain of  seats
even some former conservative members of parliament announced publicly to reporters that they would vote for the liberal democrats
of course this was a measure taken by tories under circumstances of an inevitable defeat to reduce losses by encouraging constituents who resent the tories to vote for the liberal democrats rather than labour
in the deep sorrow of defeat some conservatives are secretly feeling happy
they resent john majors leadership and would most willingly link majors incompetence and lack of vision with the bitter defeat in the local elections
even before all of the results were known some tories openly announced their determination to challenge john majors position and remove him from office as early as possible
the rightwinger michael portillo added salt to the wound by starting a dispute over the european issue and highlighted john majors image as a loser who fails to command
obviously all of these actions were long planned and are aimed at making john major suffer an even greater defeat in the european parliament elections scheduled for  june
before  june nobody will officially challenge for the position of party leader
but he who is in office must suffer the pain of electoral defeat
after  june john major will have to answer for all of the disasters and it is time to use him as a scapegoat
john major is someone who was propped up by mrs thatcher who supported appointing the mediocre john major as her successor when she was utterly isolated so that one day she would be able to pull strings from behind the scenes and continue to pursue the thatcher line
nevertheless people around john major seriously pushed him to betray thatchers doctrine while pursuing entirely new leftist policies and affecting john majors moves
for a very long period rightwingers and leftwingers argued over many domestic and world issues
john major has always been weak and powerless and vacillates to the left and to the right resulting in his own crisis of honor
on the european issue he stressed the imperative of maintaining the sovereignty cultural traditions and lifestyle of each country of the future european union while reflecting the islanders mind set
on the one hand he expressed the will to join the european family on the other he made one big stride closer to the right
while great skill is needed to have ones bread buttered on both sides john major has been relatively stupid in such circumstance
when expounding on such concepts he set out a campaign to return to basic values with an emphasis on citizen selfdiscipline taking social responsibility and obligations and being upright
however one scandal surfaced after another in his cabinet consequently british citizens saw how bombastic major could be and how he failed to know himself
the scandals caused majors reputation to collapse
for a long time john major has failed to resolve the economic crisis and has seriously jeopardized the interests of british people who have become poorer with each passing day and suffer from a high rate of unemployment
at this critical juncture john major went back on promises made during the election campaign by increasing valueadded tax on domestic fuel as a result things became even harder for the poor
he promised to reduce public expenditure but on the contrary it rose by  percent
as published john major has become an expert in making empty promises while constituents continue to scorn this dishonest prime minister
many conservatives believe that john major is driven by a gamblers mind set
at a time when his reputation was waning he wanted to start an offensive in the arena of difficult world issues regardless of british national strength
this being the case he wanted to try his luck in bosnia as well as policy toward china however he was helpless in dealing with domestic economic issues which would only lead britain to an impasse
it will be difficult for john major to lead the tories in the next general election therefore news spread earlier this year that john major would be replaced
the setback which has resulted from defeats in the local elections is heavier than expected
to accelerate a leadership reshuffle conservatives have spread the opinion that john major is not up to his office
however if politicians from various factions compete for office by taking a laissezfaire attitude the tory unity will be jeopardized
this being the case a planned transfer of power especially the reorganization of the cabinet and the replacement of the party chairman is necessary
when the new party chairman is elected the question of who will replace john major will be settled too
word has spread that john major wants chris patten to become conservative party chairman however this proposal was rejected
that should have been a party secret making public such an inside story would only provide evidence of political reality namely many conservatives did not agree to chris patten contending for this position
there are no grounds to allow a politician who has lost a previous electoral campaign to canvass votes in the next one under unfavorable electoral circumstances
that would only aggravate the torys poor image as a party which enjoys little public support and has few talents
in actual fact should john major set out such a line in appointing people that would only give more evidence of his poor ability insight and lack of judgment as well as his selfknowledge
now it is just a matter of time until he leaves office but nobody will let him make arrangements for the transfer of power
work to seek a new leader will be conducted by veteran tories how can john major be qualified for such a task
mr teg bahadur thapar was serving lunch from his stall outside the bombay stock exchange on friday when he was showered with flying glass and broken concrete in one of  explosions which rocked the city and left at least  people killed and over  injured
im lucky to be alive he said from his hospital bed
who can stop this happening again
across bombay people were asking themselves the same questions this weekend
they sensed there was an enormous difference from the riots which scarred the city in december and again in january
those were caused by a traditional mix of crime political agitation and ancient hindumoslem hatreds stirred by the destruction of the mosque in ayodhya
the weapons used were mostly primitive  knives clubs and petrol bottles
fridays outrage by contrast bears the deadly stamp of hightechnology terrorism complete with semtex plastic explosive highgrade timers efficient organisation and money
the only comparable previous incident was the assassination in  of mr rajiv gandhi the former prime minister by sri lankas tamil tiger terrorists
but that was a single bomb aimed at one man  the explosions in bombay were designed to terrorise the nations commercial capital
bombay accounts for  per cent of indias exports
mr p v narasimha rao the prime minister described the blasts as an attack on indias economy
the immediate assumption both at the highest level and in the streets of bombay was that those responsible must have been foreigners or had foreign help
but these suggestions were seen in bombay as a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from the people who in the popular mind are the real suspects  moslem extremists who might have taken revenge for the riots which hit india after the ayodhya mosques destruction and which left  dead including  in bombay
if moslems are found to have staged the attacks the indian authorities will certainly suspect that the operation was supported from a moslem country notably pakistan
the implications would be vast
breaking diplomatic relations would be the minimum step delhi could take on a dangerous road
mr rao chose his words carefully during his visit to bombay there is a definite possibility that our search may not stop within the country
i do not want to name anybody because it will have ramifications within and outside the country
there is no evidence linking the attacks to moslem extremists let alone to pakistan
even if moslem groups are found to be responsible for the bombings they could have been supplied from other moslem countries
india would still face a diplomatic crisis but hardly on the same scale
for the moment such concerns seem remote from the streets on bombay where the atmosphere yesterday was calm
workmen were clearing away rubble at the blast sites including the blackened stock exchange building
bombayites seemed determined to put the outrage behind them
at the gymkhana club and dozens of other sports grounds hundreds of men and boys were playing cricket as they do every sunday
others were walking along the seafront by the arch of the gateway of india
the stock exchange authorities plan to restart trading as soon as they can probably today  using an old trading floor the exchange vacated only last year
businessmen estimated the main loss to the city would be the loss of life and injuries and the damage caused to blasted buildings
they did not expect the same widespread disruption to production as occurred during the riots
some of the credit for the limited disruption should go the government and the police for promptly calling paramilitary and regular troops to help patrol sensitive districts
but much more should go to the people of bombay who so far at least have refused to be goaded into violent protest by the bombers

hitting baghdad where it hurts more countries have joined a unsanctioned boycott of oil from iraq and kuwait
on tuesday countries ranging from powerful japan to neutral switzerland to tiny cyprus cut off petroleum imports in an effort to convince the baghdad government to withdraw its troops that invaded kuwait on thursday
turkey announced it was shut down the twin iraqi oil pipelines that run through it to the mediterranean  carrying half of baghdads crude output  and cutting off trade with iraq
baghdads only other major pipelines exporting crude run through saudi arabia where the flow has been drastically reduced
the un security council on monday voted to impose broad economic sanctions against iraq for invading small oilrich kuwait
the measure forbids loans to iraq or kuwait and prohibits any activities including the transfer of money that would help the two countries export their goods
sanctions adopted by the european economic community on saturday froze iraqi assets and suspended the purchase of oil from the two arab countries
more than  percent of imports from iraq to the nation eec are petroleum products
the eec also suspended arms sales to iraq
switzerland which is not a member of the united nations made the unusual move tuesday of joining the un sanctions and banned all trade with iraq and iraqioccupied kuwait
in addition switzerland prohibited all payments and other financial transfers to iraq and kuwait
denmark norway and sweden also announced embargoes on all trade with both countries
japans participation in the un sanctions was seen as especially key since tokyo usually has taken a low profile in the middle east which supplies much of its petroleum needs
japan imports  percent of its oil
china joined the un decision to embargo arms sales to iraq but has been less vocal than other major countries in condemning the invasion
china sold arms to both iran and iraq during their eightyear war and is a major iraqi trade partner
cyprus sacrifice in joining the embargo was to give up  percent of its oil imports government spokesman akis fantis said
cyprus has sufficient oil supplies to last until the end of august he said but we are already in the process of taking steps to secure alternative sources  the worldwide closing of ranks against iraqi oil imports is likely to lead to even higher petroleum prices which have already risen dramatically since the invasion and could have a major impact on the world economy
wholesale oil prices soared to fiveyear highs in new york on monday
france will introduce controls thursday on prices of petroleum products to prevent refiners from using iraqs invasion of kuwait as an excuse to raise prices acting premier pierre beregovoy announced tuesday
an official with the petroleum association of japan said he was unaware of any increase yet in the price of gasoline for consumers
the official who refused to be further identified said it would be at least three months before the sanctions could be expected to force higher gas prices in japan
the democraticcontrolled senate today rejected the nomination of former texas sen john tower as defense secretary delivering a major rebuke to president bush just  days into his term
the senates  vote came after a bitter and divisive debate focused on towers drinking habits behavior toward women and his business dealings with defense contractors
it was only the ninth time in  years that the senate has voted to reject a presidents cabinet choice and the only time it has done so early in a new administration
vice president dan quayle presided over the senate during the roll call underscoring bushs commitment to the nominee
the senate galleries were packed and virtually all senators were in their seats as the roll was called
the nomination of john tower to be secretary of defense is not confirmed quayle intoned after the vote
kansas gop sen nancy kassebaum provided the biggest surprise of the final hours of debate when she became the sole republican to declare her opposition
she said her most serious concerns were over towers activities as a defense consultant after serving as an arms control negotiator
she also expressed doubts that he would pay enough attention to ensuring fairness for women in the military
towers republican defenders began to speak of him in the past tense and the nominee also appeared to accept defeat even before the roll was called
just moments ago i took a call from john tower said sen john warner of virginia the senior gop member of the senate armed services committee
his head is high his voice is strong warner said
he asked me to convey thanks  in his words  to the troops who rallied to his support
senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine moved to repair damage caused by the bitter struggle to relations between the senate and president bush
i know whats in my heart and in my mind he told reporters
i want to directly clearly and unambiguously say that this doesnt represent an effort to be harmful to the president
dole agreed to a lateafternoon vote on the nomination after acknowledging the collapse of a lastminute bid to give tower an extraordinary sixmonth trial period as defense secretary to prove he could abstain from drinking
there was no doubt about the outcome as the senate went through the motions of debating the nomination through the final hours before the roll call
the last few undecided senators declared their positions
sen john b breaux dla said he would vote against tower
sen james m jeffords rvt said he would support the nomination
senators from both parties credited towers defeat to the decision to oppose him made by sen sam nunn dga chairman of the armed services committee
when he made his decision all the other democrats wheeled in behind him said sen john chafee rri with the prospect of defeat seemingly inevitable white house press secretary marlin fitzwater said if necessary well come up with a new candidate very rapidly
names most frequently mentioned in white house speculation as a replacement for tower if his nomination failed are sen warner a former secretary of the navy former defense secretary donald rumsfeld former rep jack edwards rala and national security adviser brent scowcroft
scowcroft replied no when asked this morning if he was in line for the pentagon job
it must be clear to all that people like the chief of staff and the national security adviser any number of congressmen and senators and any number of other outside experts have candidates on the tip of their tongue fitzwater said
but the time has not come he added
the time will come as soon as the vote is completed
we will wait until then
the most recent associated press survey showed  democrats and one republican committed to vote against tower or leaning strongly in that direction
it showed  republicans and three democrats declared for tower or leaning his way
nevertheless the white house said it wanted to see the nomination go all the way to a vote
tower meanwhile reported for work at the pentagon where he and his three daughters had coffee together
he then continued a review of various administration proposals
i hope and believe we can work together on important matters mitchell said
the tension of this issue will have no longlasting effect on the relationship
i want to say from the bottom of my heart that i hope this will be the case
the already slim chance tower would be confirmed was dealt a crushing blow on wednesday as a parade of previously undecided democratic senators announced they would vote no
only democrat lloyd bentsen of texas said he would vote yes joining just two other democrats who have made that decision
sens
charles robb dva joseph lieberman dconn j bennett johnston dla dale bumpers dark and claiborne pell dri all said they would vote against tower
johnston said his reading of the fbi report on tower leaves him with the clear impression that towers personality changes when he drinks heavily leading to a recklessness in the social sense entirely different from his behavior when sober
japanese writer kazuo ishiguro won the  booker prize britains top literary award for his novel the remains of the day judges announced thursday
the prize is worth 
judges praised the novel a love story about a butlers english vacation as a cunningly structured and beautifully paced performance
other finalists this year were canadian margaret atwood for cats eye irish author john banville for book of evidence scotlands james kelman for a disaffection and english writers sybille bedford for jigsaw and rose tremain for restoration
after receiving the prize ishiguro paid tribute to salman rushdie the  runnerup for the award who went into hiding in february when he was threatened with death by moslems who said his novel the satanic verses blasphemed their faith
now that circumstances have changed when perhaps it is inconvenient for many people to support his writing i just felt it was fitting that we should not turn our backs on him ishiguro said
rushdie lives in england
ishiguro  arrived in england at age  and now lives in south london
he writes in english
in announcing the winner the judges said the remains of the day renders with humor and pathos a memorable character and explores the large vexed themes of class tradition and duty
it was narrowly preferred but universally admired
ishiguro was a finalist for the booker prize in  for his novel an artist of the floating world
the booker prize is sponsored by booker an international food and agriculture business
dan quayles sister believes the indiana senator wont let his candidacy for vice president hurt the family life he and his wife marilyn enjoy
i dont think it will be tough on the family said martha saddler quayles sister who lives in huntington ind
since hes been in politics we all kind of shake our heads at his hectic schedule and wonder how he does it
but he does it and loves it
the quayle family and friends were celebrating tuesday afternoon after george bush announced he wants the yearold indiana senator to be the republican nominee for vice president
those who have known the quayles for years said the senator and his wife have remained relatively unchanged by their years in public life
dan and marilyn quayle met as law students in indianapolis married while they were still in school and remain close to many of their friends from that period
one of the greatest things about him is the job of being a senator has not changed him a bit said indianapolis attorney william r neale treasurer of quayles  reelection campaign
hes the same nice guy he was in law school
neale who grew up with marilyn tucker quayle in indianapolis introduced dan quayle to his future wife at a student gathering at the indiana university law school in the early s
dan quayle who grew up in huntington graduated from depauw university a small liberal arts college in greencastle ind before going to work in the indiana attorney generals office in 
daniel f evans also a law school classmate of dan quayle said he doesnt expect quayles national candidacy to change him
i think his strength is hell remember who his friends are even after this said evans who was chairman of quayles  campaign
friends said the quayles are devoted to their three children and prefer quiet nights at home to nights out on the town in washington
his family looks like the family both parties are trying to appeal to said mitch daniels former political chief in the white house and now president of the hudson institute
its a beautiful family
i think theyll be a real asset
the couple who married in  have a yearold son tucker a yearold son benjamin and a yearold daughter corinne
when they campaign in indiana the quayles often tour in two groups  the boys riding in parades with marilyn quayle and corinne and her father visiting county fairs
the kids are nonchalant normal kids said mrs saddler
they take it in stride and play
in an interview with indiana reporters monday the quayles said they had worried during the vice presidential speculation about the familys loss of privacy during a national campaign
the total lack of privacy is going to be the biggest minus said mrs quayle 
quayle said he had questioned each of his children about whether he should accept the vice presidential spot if bush offered it
tucker was fascinated by the idea quayle said
benjamin was ambiguous but he thought secret service agents might be able to help him on tests at school mrs quayle said
corinne didnt like the prospect of having her father spend more time away from home quayle said
she told me daddy i really hope george bush picks bob dole said quayle
the death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern ohio increased to  sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the ohio river
eighteen people remained missing
workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags where search dogs indicated they had detected human scents national guard capt
jim boling said
divers worked where the two creeks empty into the ohio
one body was found sunday in debris along wegee creek about three miles from where it meets the river said belmont county coroners investigator chuck vogt
another was pulled from the ohio near a bridge at moundsville w va about  miles south of shadyside he said
the body of a man was found sunday afternoon in the ohio river a halfmile south of the mouth of wegee creek and about seven miles south of shadyside vogt said
that brought the confirmed death toll in thursdays floods to  including five children
twentythree dog teams from four states were searching for victims
the digging will continue at least through tuesday fire chief mark badia said
the thing you find once you start into these brush piles and piles of trees are cars and they have to be torn apart and searched separately badia said
everything you turn up creates a different situation
vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found alive
its just been too long
i dont think theres anybody alive out there he said
you cant swim out there that long in the ohio river
the wegee and pipe creeks overflowed thursday night during storms that poured   inches of rain onto eastern ohio in   hours
the floods destroyed as many as  houses and damaged up to  others
authorities said friday that  people were missing some of those were later found dead while others notified authorities that they were safe
officials also learned that some of those feared missing had moved out of the area
officials were comparing county property lists and data from the census bureau with information from residents and relatives boling said
that left  still missing vogt said
the list was not revised to account for the third body found sunday afternoon because the man had not been identified
investigators sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of three bridges over the creeks
badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks forming dams at each bridge
the dams broke under the water pressure
eventually the bridges couldnt hold any more
the debris broke loose and thats when we got three big gushes of water he said
as rescue efforts continued the national guard cleared roads and bridges leading into the stricken area
eighteen ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas since tornadoes and flooding first struck may 
ethnic violence killed  people and wounded  this month in the central asian republic of kirghizia the official news agency tass said wednesday
tass said  of the injured had to be hospitalized and said a search was continuing for a police officer who vanished june 
no new outbreaks were reported in the region near the border city of osh in western kirghizia where clashes arising from a land dispute began on june  between ethnic kirghiz and uzbeks both sunni moslems
the argument involves allocation of land in a densly populated region where housing is scarce
it was the latest in a series of bloody civil conflicts to trouble president mikhail s gorbachevs government
maj gen alexander grienko chief of the interior ministrys political department said that in two years of civil strife  mainly ethnic clashes  in the soviet union about  people have been arrested
he said in moscow on tuesday that ministry troops had to be used in  regions of the soviet union because of such outbreaks tass said
grienko said  ministry soldiers were killed four were reported missing and more than  wounded
tass did not quote grienko on how civilians casualties
the general was quoted as saying these conflicts were often accompanied by riots and pogroms arson and massacre of innocent people and complete or partial destabilization of the situation
besides unrest this month in kirghizia and uzbekistan ethnic violence also has been reported in recent years in georgia armenia azerbaijan kazakhstan and tadzhikistan
a hermosa beach minister who for years has tried in vain to quell rumors tying his church to the mcmartin preschool scandal announced sunday that the extreme stress of fallout from the case has forced him to seek disability retirement
the rev
john d eales of st cross episcopal church  where mcmartin pupils claimed they had been forced to take part in satanic rituals  told the congregation during his sermon that after much prayer and consultation he realized his health could not withstand the continuing harassment and vandalization the church has borne as a result of the unsubstantiated claims
the mcmartin case which prompted the longest and most expensive criminal trial in us history ended thursday with the acquittal of defendants ray buckey and peggy mcmartin buckey on a total of  counts of child molestation at the manhattan beach school
the jurors deadlocked on  other counts
nonetheless the case continues to divide and haunt the south bay communities where it was centered
st cross was never named as a defendant in the case and neither eales nor any other official of the venerable seaside church was ever formally charged
but since  the church has struggled to shake a mcmartin pupils allegation during the preliminary hearing that six years earlier he and other students had been forced to witness animal sacrifices and satanic rituals at the altar of st cross
when the thenyearold boys allegation was reported in the local media other children claimed that they too had been abused at the church
though investigators using sophisticated equipment checked the altar and found no trace of blood attendance dropped drastically at the church and the churchrun preschool which closed soon afterward
the allegations never died despite the passage of time and the announcement by los angeles county sheriffs investigators that they had found no evidence to support the childrens claims
periodically over the years eales said he would receive threatening phone calls at the church and rectory and the harassment increased as the mcmartin case began to wind down
twice in december the church and rectory were pelted with bottles and rotten eggs
in a note left in the rectory driveway after the second attack the vandals who identified themselves as the beach cities conscience warned that there is simply no place for satan worship in this town
the harassment was exacerbated by the arrest shortly after christmas of a youth counselor at the church who was charged with molesting two teenage boys he had met through his work at st cross
the counselor it turned out was a convicted child molester who had been brought into the fold about a year and a half earlier by an assistant pastor who was hired after the mcmartin case broke
then just days after that assistant pastor resigned the mcmartin verdict came down and according to several church members the anonymous phone calls returned
its kind of like a violin string  you can only tighten it so far and then it snaps eales said sunday
though at  eales has  more years until the diocese would mandate his retirement he said his doctors told him that the kind of stress you have been under kills
because of that he said he plans to extend a medical leave already scheduled to allow for some minor surgery next week and retire a year short of the year tenure that was his goal when he came to st cross
his decision shocked and saddened parishioners who credited eales with shepherding the church through difficult times
said ron russell a year member of the congregation we brought a good strong man in here and  well this has ruined him

such is the life of one german shorthaired pointer a show dog bearing the name ch
robin crest lorien corniche
cory as he is called for short isnt any runofthelitter critter
the ch
in his name stands for champion
he has won  show awards as best of breed and  awards as best in show
basically his problem comes from serving more than one master
one of the dogs three owners thinks the kennelclub world has seen enough of cory who is four years old
the other two owners think he has plenty of prizes still ahead
in what is fast becoming a pitbull match the one owner anthony attalla is suing the other two john and rita remondi charging that they have been showing cory even though he is officially retired as announced in dog news
in the suit filed in federal district court in manhattan mr attalla says cory has achieved the pinnacle of success 
and any further competition would only diminish what he has accomplished
mr attalla claims that his work with cory is no gravy train
in the suit he says that under the owners agreement he lays out fees and other expenses for showing the animal and he decides when to show  or to retire  cory
so far mr attalla says hes spent over  the amount sought in damages
in return he is entitled to all ribbons and awards
the remondis are in charge of caring for the dog
despite the retirement the suit says the remondis showed cory twice recently
he placed fourth and then didnt place at all
for now a judges order temporarily bars them from further shows
in a memo filed in court mr remondi claims that mr attalla retired the dog simply and solely to better the chances that mr attallas agent would win with a rival rover
the remondis also say mr attalla has bought a rottweiler to show in another category and doesnt want to spend money on both cory and the other dog
they claim that mr attalla has breached the pact by not paying certain expenses
stud fees are also at issue
the remondis argue that the retirement fraudulently deprives them of their opportunity to show cory a dog who they assert is in the best condition of his life
while hurricane andrew was wreaking havoc across large parts of southern florida and louisiana this week a grade two dollar crisis on a onetofour scale four being most severe was blowing itself out at the end of a tumultuous few days for us and world financial markets
on wall street most of the damage from the currency storm was inflicted a week ago friday and on the following monday when bond yields jumped sharply and the dow jones industrial average plunged by more than  points
the flimsy walls erected hastily by the federal reserve and other big central banks to protect the vulnerable dollar from a tidal wave of selling on foreign exchange markets failed to hold and as the sellers poured through the breached barricades the currency dropped to dm
this was its lowestever point against the dmark
the conditions necessary for a dollar crisis had been building up in currency markets for some time
interest rate differentials between us and germany widened over the summer as the fed eased and the bundesbank tightened their respective monetary policies
the failure of the us economy to climb out of recession with any vigour was also making overseas investors increasingly unhappy about holding the dollar
so too was the political hole president bush had dug for himself in a reelection battle that only a year ago was supposed to be a shooin for the incumbent
moreover the fact that almost every central bank worth its salt was in the markets trying to prop up the dollar served only to convince foreign exchange dealers that the currency was heading in one direction  down
while there were plenty of reasons for the dealers to sell the dollar the logic for such a strongly negative reaction from bond and stock markets was less obviously compelling
there are two standard explanations why a weak dollar prompts bond prices to fall
the first is that it raises import prices and as a result adds to inflationary pressures
the second is that it makes it hard for the fed to engineer another cut in interest rates to stimulate the flagging recovery and raises the possibility that rates may actually have to go up to protect the currency
the first explanation is not particularly convincing  imports account for not much more than  per cent of us gross domestic product so higher import prices do not greatly effect the overall price level which is now around  per cent and heading lower
the second explanation carries more weight
although there is not much chance given the present economic and political climate that the fed will raise rates to help the dollar there is little doubt that the currencys weakness makes it extremely difficult for the fed to ease monetary policy again
the fear that the fed may be done with interest rate cuts for the present economic cycle was also behind the selling in equity markets
but investors in stocks were equally if not more troubled by the rise in bond yields
just over a week ago the yield on the benchmark year bond which has remained stubbornly high all year despite the poor state of the economy looked as if it might drop below  per cent
the dollar put paid to those hopes and by the middle of this week it was approaching  per cent putting an upward pressure on the allimportant mortgage rate for homebuyers
the dollar was not the only story in financial markets this week and the devastating effect of hurricane andrew produced a typically hardeyed although nonetheless logical reaction from wall street
the stocks of those insurance companies with the greatest exposure in southern florida the area hit worst by the hurricane all took a tumble
but the relatively modest losses in geico travelers and progressive suggested that the market believed the insurers were reserved or reinsured adequately enough to cover hurricanerelated claims
the flip side of the hurricanes coin was a strong showing from the stocks of home construction companies expected to benefit from demand for rebuilding damaged or destroyed homes
since there are an estimated  people left homeless by the storm there is a lot of work to be done
the biggest gains among construction stocks this week were posted by lennar oakwood homes engle homes and fleetwood the largest maker of premanufactured homes in the us
jurors in the mcmartin preschool molestation case denounced the techniques of a child therapy center and a police department letter that inflamed parents and ignited the case
seven jurors who spoke with reporters in a joint news conference after acquitting raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey on  molestation charges thursday said they felt some children who testified may have been molested  but not at the familyrun mcmartin preschool
and they said some children may have merely repeated stories told them by their parents and interviewers at childrens institute international
the private child therapy center which specializes in abused children videotaped interviews with children from the mcmartin school after reports of molestations surfaced
jurors saw the tapes in which interviewers used anatomically explicit puppets and leading questions to elicit descriptions of molestation from children
asked what led to acquittals juror brenda williams focused on the taped interviews from the center jurors call cii
the cii interviews  i could not accept them mrs williams said
i believe the children believe what they were saying was true
but at cii i could not tell if the children were saying what was told to them by interviewers or if they were repeating what their parents had told them
if the cii tapes had not been entered into evidence and i had not seen them i could have believed the children a little more mrs williams said
the cii tapes did not help me
they gave me a lot of reasonable doubt agreed juror julie peters  a supermarket meat wrapper
the children were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them
all the questions were leading
they never had a chance to tell their stories said juror john breese  a medical technician and grandfather of five
i tried to believe the children said juror daryl hutchins  an oil company lease operator
but if the child was so contaminated by the interviews i couldnt
equal criticism was aimed at a letter sent in  by the manhattan beach police department to parents of mcmartin school children
the letter alerted parents to a claim of molestation at the school and to buckeys arrest
the police letter should never have been sent said juror sally cordova  a supermarket checker
it put the information out there too early
the whole city knew
at that point jurors said they felt parents had been programmed to believe their children had been molested
one child said his parents told him that he was molested even before he went to cii mrs williams recalled
the panelists said they threw out entirely the most fantastic allegations including some childrens accounts of being molested in a car wash we just dismissed those said mrs williams
they said a series of medical slides shown to them lacked impact because they werent sure what they were seeing in the photos of childrens genitals
although they acquitted defendants of most charges the jurors deadlocked on  counts
some said they were unsure whether buckey was a molester but were sure the prosecution had failed to prove its molestation allegations against him beyond a reasonable doubt
jurors said they didnt rule out that some children in the case were molested  but not by these defendants
even if you accept that the children were molested said juror mark bassett the evidence didnt establish that they were molested at the mcmartin preschool
the panelists said they were aware of the trials enormous toll on defendants as well as children and parents
i think everybody is a victim said ms peters
i dont think anybody came out of this case a winner
i think its sad because everybody lost something
the defendants  their lives have been ruined
they lost their business their reputation
its sad
mrs williams added the children have to live with this
the parents have to live with this
theres nothing i can say that will make it better
as for themselves the jurors said their lives were put on hold for nearly three years
bassett lost his job as a research computer scientist when his company folded
mrs williams got married
breese said his wife died during the trial and he has since remarried
its been very hard said mrs williams a telephone company service representative
there were days when i thought i couldnt stand it anymore
i dont really know my job anymore she said
its going to be hard getting back into the real world
the jury foreman and four other jurors declined interviews
though the historic mcmartin preschool criminal trial finally has ended in acquittals a host of civil lawsuits generated by the manhattan beach molestation case conceivably could keep the issue alive in the courts for decades legal experts say
a confusing array of civil actions await resolution
these include a federal civil rights suit filed friday by peggy mcmartin buckey against her accusers and others a lawsuit filed by former defendants against a television station and reporter and suits the preschool owners have filed against their liability insurance carriers
also ray buckey might file a federal suit similar to that of his mother said his attorney scott bernstein
and an attorney representing several parents of mcmartin attendees said they might now refile lawsuits against the preschool for emotional distress allegedly suffered by the children
im convinced this case will never end eli gauna who represents babette spitler a former teacher at the school said wearily
it will always be there until everyone who was ever involved gets to old age or dies
in the criminal case  the longest and costliest criminal proceeding in us history  ray buckey  and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey  were acquitted thursday of  counts of molestation involving  youngsters who attended the family nursery school in manhattan beach
the jury deadlocked on  remaining counts and a mistrial was declared on those allegations
a decision is expected next week over whether those charges will be refiled against ray buckey
the verdict was a high mark but not the final moment in a lengthy and entangled legal saga
the criminal case began in march  when seven mcmartin teachers were indicted by a county grand jury on  counts of molestation
the indictment was superseded by a criminal complaint of  counts of molestation and conspiracy
after an month preliminary hearing all seven were ordered to stand trial
defendants included buckey his mother his grandmother virginia mcmartin who was the school founder his sister peggy ann buckey and teachers spitler betty raidor and mary ann jackson
but a week after the hearing ended dist
atty
ira reiner dropped charges against the latter five defendants citing incredibly weak evidence
even before the criminal case went to trial civil litigation already was in the works
in  a handful of lawsuits were filed by  families seeking monetary damages against the school for medical bills cost of psychiatric therapy and emotional distress arising from the alleged molestations
but those lawsuits later were withdrawn to prevent the childrens psychiatric histories from being introduced as evidence in the criminal case
greg mooney an attorney who represented some of the plaintiffs explained that during the criminal preliminary hearing defense attorneys had sought psychiatric records of the alleged victims
defense attorneys argued that they should be entitled to the records because the children had waived their patienttherapist confidentiality by filing civil suits in which their psychiatric histories would be at issue
the civil suits were withdrawn so they would not become an issue in the criminal case mooney said
he said friday however that the civil lawsuits can now be refiled
mooney said a decision on whether to refile will be made only after authorities decide what to do with the  remaining criminal counts
its impossible to predict how many parents will want to sue mooney said
somewhere between a handful and a bushelful
any new suits would have to be filed only on behalf of the children
the parents could not seek damages on their own because the oneyear statute of limitations  the deadline in which a lawsuit can be filed  has passed
under state law children who allege abuse have until they are  years old to file
many of the children who attended mcmartin are now entering their early teens but the youngest of those who attended the school then is now  years old
legal experts however say some courts have held that child abuse victims can file at any time in their life
in the socalled delayeddiscovery theory a statute of limitations does not take effect until the victim actually becomes aware of molestation and some victims might suppress memories of such attacks for years
its a possibility that hangs over the former defendants said attorney gauna noting a recent landmark california court decision that set aside the statute of limitations for certain victims
mooney said he knows of families that seeking legal advantage waited for the criminal trial to end before contemplating civil action
he explained that some families believed they might have a better advantage in civil court rather than in a criminal case the burden of proof in civil litigation is the preponderance of the evidence not reasonable doubt as in a criminal trial
also in a civil case only nine of the  jurors must agree on a verdict
criminal convictions require unanimous juries
whether the families would be willing to tackle more years of legal proceedings is yet to be seen
and some families question whether the mcmartin defendants insurance carriers would pay out to plaintiffs who successfully sued the school
there hasnt been any decisions yet
the parents need a little space between the events of this week and deciding what they will do mooney said
there is some sentiment that says lets just put this behind us
but there is also sentiment among others that maybe they should pick up the civil case where the criminal case left off
they heard the jurors when they said they believed that things happened to the children
they think maybe since the criminal jury couldnt get the higher standard of proof a civil jury would bring about a resolution
said one mcmartin attendees parent who asked not to be identified i might be tempted to file a civil suit to provide a trust fund for my child
but there apparently isnt any money there to be had
the only other reasons for filing such a suit the parent added would be to work through a lot of emotional things and we have already done that by participating in the criminal proceedings
gauna spitlers attorney said the litigation will go on because maybe a halfdozen to a dozen hardline parents wont let it go away
they will live this case until the day they die
meanwhile already wending its way through court is a lawsuit filed by the early defendants
peggy ann buckey virginia mcmartin spitler and raidor are suing the television station the reporter who broke the mcmartin story and others
the suit alleges that the station and reporter wayne satz were creating rather than reporting the news
a lower court held that the station kabc was protected from the action on constitutional grounds but a state appellate court ruled the case should proceed to trial and the state supreme court upheld that decision
the case now in the early pretrial stages is being watched closely because it could set precedent in the field of press law experts said
another suit pits former mcmartin defendants and the preschool against their liability insurance carriers
the mcmartin side alleges that the insurance carriers were required by the policy to pay for their attorney bills
while the insurers have paid a portion of the defense costs they contend the defendants should have used only one attorney
however the defendants are arguing that because of possible conflicts of interest each needed their own counsel
one of the former defendants preschool teacher maryann jackson settled out of court
as it becomes apparent that mcmartin cases will stretch out for years to come parents and the former criminal defendants alike are trying to resign themselves to the inevitability that the matter may be one they can never leave behind
soon some of the children will be able to make their own legal decisions
noted one parent its really not our decision as parents anymore
these children will soon be adults
president bush is expected to name a female career diplomat as us ambassador to nicaragua as that country prepares for a new era under presidentelect violeta chamorro according to informed sources
the sources said thursday it is virtually certain the appointment will go to melissa wells  currently ambassador to mozambique
they said the administration believed a female ambassador could relate better than a man to mrs chamorro who takes office wednesday
they also said the administration is eager to have more women in key posts
only rarely have us ambassadorships in latin america gone to women
in choosing ms wells the administration passed over several male career diplomats with long experience in that region said the sources who asked not to be identified
ms wells who was born in estonia has no prior experience in latin america
her personnel record indicates she speaks spanish
wells name was submitted to the white house by secretary of state james a baker iii for the managua post and approval is considered  percent certain one source said
the united states and nicaragua have not had ambassadors in each others capitals since july 
the sandinista government expelled thenus ambassador richard melton and seven other us diplomats on the grounds they were interfering in nicaraguas internal affairs
the reagan administration retaliated by expelling nicaraguan ambassador carlos tunnermann and seven of his subordinates from the nicaraguan embassy here
but a new era in usnicaraguan relations is expected to open with the inauguration of mrs chamorro who defeated president daniel ortega in elections this february
vice president dan quayle and a large congressional delegation are expected to represent bush at her inaugural
the administration has asked congress for  million in assistance to nicaragua part of which would be used for resettling contra rebels
but the request has been stalled by senate democrats some of whom believe that eastern europe has a greater claim on us resources than nicaragua
wells nomination as ambassador to mozambique in  encountered strong opposition from senate conservatives who held up the appointment for  months in protest against us policy toward that country
the nomination finally was approved in september 
sen jesse helms rnc a leader of the campaign to hold up wells nomination said he wanted to pressure the administration into dealing with rightist guerrillas opposed to mozambiques marxist government
mozambique has since moderated its policies and is now off the us governments list of countries under marxist rule
neighbors were breakfasting heading to work or asleep in bed when an explosion at a military barracks turned their homes to rubble and they were confronted with the sight of bodies being carried away
there was a terrific crash which reminded me of the blitz
after that the ceiling started to fall down around me said joan betteridge a pensioner in the southern england town of deal where the blast at the royal marines school of music occurred
the irish republican army claimed reponsibilty for the explosion which police said killed  people and injured 
nearby resident sean minnock said i was asleep but woke up with a hell of a jolt  the bedroom ceiling fell in on me
i woke to find huge slabs of plaster on the bed and floor
from the wrecked smokeclouded barracks i could hear terrified screams of agony
people started rushing about all over the place
it was horrible to watch and listen to said minnock 
i knew people had been seriously hurt
i saw the rescuers pull out two bodies
i knew they were dead when they put them on the floor and put bed blankets right over them
minnocks wife janet said the roof of their house was torn off and all the back windows were shattered
the house has been blown to bits she said
mrs minnock was feeding her yearold son thomas his breakfast when the explosion wrecked four terraced houses in the street backing onto the barracks
her nextdoor neighbor heather hackett  was standing at her kitchen window facing the barracks holding her monthold son luke in her arms
her other boys ben  and joshua  were at her side
i looked up from the sink and i just saw the whole building explode she said
i told the boys to run and as joshua turned a sliver of glass embedded itself in his back
the whole window was blown across the kitchen
i just screamed and ran out of the room
the bang was so loud i thought the whole house was coming in
at first i thought for sure joshua had been seriously injured
there was blood coming out of his back
doctors removed the glass and sent him home
college student simon mitford  narrowly escaped being injured in the explosion because he got up earlier than usual
his room was completely wrecked by the blast his brother alex said
of the barracks he said i heard music playing and then it went bang and there was glass everywhere
it was a twostory building but now  percent of it is rubble
i heard a marine scream out the band is under there
i was scared there was going to be a second explosion
prime minister margaret thatchers international admirers praised her courage and achievements thursday after she announced she would resign
even her foes tempered scorn with praise for a formidable adversary
said president bush i will miss her
he called her an outstanding ally of the united states adding you always knew where she was and what she believed
vitaly ignatenko spokesman for soviet president mikhail gorbachev told the independent interfax news agency political economic and cultural ties between our countries have become of greater importance in the thatcher era
our relations  were marked by constructivism and dialogue
the reluctance mrs thatcher showed toward increasing european unity was the source of most criticism
but in a joyful and unambiguous response iraq saw the persian gulf crisis as cause of her downfall
bitterness was undisguised in the comment from argentinas nicanor costa mendez foreign minister during his countrys  falklands war with britain
i cant say that it makes me sad he said
i believe that the extreme positions  unnecessarily extreme unjustifiably extreme  of the prime minister were one of the causes of the war and one of the biggest impediments to achieve agreement after
socialist president mario soares of portugal singled out her systematic opposition to the advances of the european community
during her long mandate he said the preoccupations of social justice receded many times before purely development objectives causing a climate of discontent in british public opinion to which mrs thatcher appeared insensitive
but soares also lauded the british prime minister as a determined politician who took courageous positions on critical occasions in international life and without doubt marked an era in the contemporary history of her country
german finance minister theo waigel noted despite her critical position on some questions of european integration she accomplished a great deal for european politics
a neutral letter from socialist president francois mitterrand of france told mrs thatcher she had marked an important moment in the history of your country and that of europe
iraqi government spokesman naji alhadithi said growing opposition to her hard line against iraq over its invasion of kuwait buried mrs thatcher just as the  crisis over britains attack on the suez canal ruined former prime minister anthony eden
britain stepped in after egypt nationalized the canal
on thursday britain announced it was nearly doubling its troops deployed in the gulf as part of the multinational force arrayed against iraq sending  more soldiers to join the  already in the region
south african president fw
de klerk praised mrs thatcher who opposed sanctions on south africa for standing up to world pressure and standing by pretoria
she had faith in south africas ability to solve its problems in a democratic way  she had the courage of her convictions he said
prime minister yitzhak shamir of israel saidafter hearing of her resignation that israel feels a moment of sorrow because we all know this special personality mrs thatcher who did many things and was an outstanding leader
prime minister toshiki kaifu of japan said the british prime minister is a rare leader of firm convictions who was invigorated the united kingdom and i feel great regret that she has withdrawn from the front line
belgiums prime minister wilfried martens applauded the determining role she played during more than  years in her own country and on the international scene
said prime minister bob hawke of australia even those like myself who have been at odds with margaret thatcher on particular issues have admired her courage and tenacity of purpose
whatever the forces arrayed against her she was always prepared to pursue with the utmost vigor those positions in which she believed
dutch prime minister ruud lubbers said in the many years that she placed such an important stamp on the policies of the united kingdom mrs thatcher has shown that she does not avoid making difficult decisions that she deems to be in the nations interest
this too is such a decision which deserves respect
former french president valery giscard destaing now a legislator in the european parliament said mrs thatchers decision to quit was dignified and courageous
margaret thatcher will be seen with winston churchill as the greatest british prime minister of the last  years
the curtain has fallen on the iron lady
she deserves our congratulations
even european commission president jacques delors mrs thatchers archenemy in europe spoke of his high esteem for her despite their differences
alfred dregger parliamentary leader of germanys governing christian democratic union said mrs thatcher played a major role in securing western solidarity in the historical conflict for freedom and democracy
we thank her for that
former president reagan spoke with great warmth of his closest foreign ally
margaret thatchers resoluteness played a key role in ending the cold war he said
she stood up to the soviets and let them know she meant business
her deep and abiding dedication to the principles of liberty and democracy served as an inspiration to oppressed peoples everywhere who knew that margaret thatcher would never waver in her belief that all men and women are entitled to live in freedom
a representative of the african national congress said saturday the south african government may release black nationalist leader nelson mandela as early as tuesday
there are very strong rumors in south africa today that on nov  nelson mandela will be released said yusef saloojee chief representative in canada for the anc which is fighting to end whiteminority rule in south africa
mandela the yearold leader of the anc jailed  years ago was sentenced to life in prison for conspiring to overthrow the south african government
he was transferred from prison to a hospital in august for treatment of tuberculosis
since then it has been widely rumored mandela will be released by christmas in a move to win strong international support for the south african government
it will be a victory for the people of south africa and indeed a victory for the whole of africa saloojee told an audience at the university of toronto
a south african government source last week indicated recent rumors of mandelas impending release were orchestrated by members of the antiapartheid movement to pressure the government into taking some action
and a prominent antiapatheid activist in south africa said there has been no indication mandela would be released today or in the near future
apartheid is south africas policy of racial separation
in a major rebuff to the soviet unions scientific establishment soviet physicists friday nominated nobel laureate andrei d sakharov to run as a candidate in nationwide parliamentary elections scheduled for march
the overwhelming vote in favor of the yearold humanrights advocate by his colleagues at moscows leading physics institute came only two days after his candidacy was rejected by the governing board of the academy of sciences
the attempt to prevent sakharov from running for a revamped soviet parliament has outraged soviet intellectuals
during a marathon session that ended late wednesday the governing board of the academy of sciences selected  scientists as candidates to fill  specially reserved seats in the new congress of peoples deputies
sakharov and several other leading reformers including the former director of the soviet space institute roald sagdeyev failed to win nomination
sakharov supported during secret balloting friday at the prestigious lebedev institute the physicists supported sakharovs candidacy by a vote of  to 
the outcome was more an expression of respect for sakharov as a man who stuck by his principles during difficult times than a specific endorsement of all his political views
sakharov however used the occasion to outline his hopes for a multiparty system public control over the kgb security police and the convergence of communism and capitalism
although sakharov has publicly expressed his support for president mikhail s gorbachev in recent months he seems to have become increasingly concerned about the slow and uneven pace of reform
in a questionandanswer session with physicists he described the political situation in the soviet union as extremely complicated
far from delighted i am far from being delighted about all the things that have happened in our country over the last year
in many ways our domestic policies have either been indecisive or incorrect he said
sakharov who acted as an unofficial kremlin envoy to the troubled transcaucasian region last month said he was particularly dismayed by a government crackdown against leading armenian nationalists
he called for the release from prison of members of the outlawed karabakh committee which has been campaigning for the secession of the largely armenianinhabited region of nagornokarabakh from azerbaijan
the  nobel peace prize winner outlined a detailed political program which if implemented would totally transform the soviet union
he called for total freedom of movement and association
although sakharov has now been nominated as a candidate from the october electoral district of moscow it is by no means certain that his name will appear on the march  ballot
under the complicated voting procedures it is still possible to strike down his candidacy during the socalled preelectoral campaign if more than two candidates have been nominated
ray will die is scrawled in big black letters on the faded green paint of the mcmartin preschool testimony to the rage inflamed by the notorious childmolesting case
former mcmartin teachers raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were acquitted thursday of  charges of molesting students
jurors were deadlocked on  other counts
whatever happens on those charges few in this uppermiddleclass los angeles suburb would disagree with the judge in the trial william pounders who once said the case has poisoned everyone who had contact with it
sue brown a receptionist at a medical office across the street from the school said she had two friends who were involved in the case and had been convinced of the buckeys guilt
i think they got off scotfree brown said
im really sick about it
alan lagunoff whose son now  testified against the buckeys stood in front of the rundown longclosed nursery school and talked about his disappointment
the defense did everything to prolong the case and the prosecution did not do enough research to prosecute the case properly he said
a cold wind blasted leaves across the schoolyard as lagunoff leaned on the rusted chainlink fence surrounding the dilapidated lshaped building
id like to see the school become a center for abused children he said
it should be put to some good use rather than tear it down
but another longtime manhattan beach resident disagreed
id like to see it torn down said brenda platt
id like to have no memories of this
platt who has two children aged  and  said she has serious doubts about placing them in a daycare center because of the mcmartin trial
i think the mcmartin case is a disgrace to manhattan beach and society
its totally upsetting platt said
linda geisert another resident of the beach city was also upset
im greatly disappointed in the legal system and quite frankly in the jurors geisert said
for all his disappointment lagunoff said he did not feel the prosecutors should retry the remaining  counts
it would be just more of the same circus he said
we put so much faith and hope in our courts said robert canter 
and this is what we get  frustration
an antiamerican newspaper in iran said sunday the united states is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last weeks earthquake
the criminal role of america in irans past became evident once again in the recent earthquake the jomhuri islami said in an editorial reported by the official islamic republic news agency
our people even under the rubble chant death to america and pray to god to cut off the hands of the united states  even those hands stretched out to help it said
it argued that by plundering irans oil and other resources for  years the united states had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and advanced antiseismic building construction systems
even after its expulsion from iran the us government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots halted the renovation of the country the editorial added
the newspaper was implying that with these actions the united states had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures
if the united states has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the iranian nation it should do only one thing stop hatching plots the newspaper said
it called on iranians to reject relief offers by the united states and other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the iranian people
iran at odds with the united states since the  seizure of hostages at the us embassy in tehran has said it would welcome relief from the american red cross and other us humanitarian groups
the two nations have no diplomatic ties
setting aside years of animosity the us government joined with private humanitarian groups friday to funnel medicine tents clothing food and other relief materials to help earthquakestricken iran
state department officials said the government gave  worth of supplies to the american red cross for shipment to iran  including  hard hats  pairs of leather gloves  face masks  wool blankets and about  tents
the us military which often is used to ferry relief supplies to countries in need stood ready to offer transport planes and logistics support for any us aid requested by iran
however a pentagon official said it is unlikely that the state department and the white house would authorize a military airlift of supplies
its pretty clear that the iranians dont want us and there are so many alternatives such as private charters it really isnt necessary the officials said
in a case like this we would really be more of an irritant than a help
the quake which rocked the northern region of iran early thursday left nearly  dead by official count and about  homeless
the death toll is expected to rise however as rescuers continue work
late thursday the iranian red crescent appealed for help from the red cross and red crescent society a genevabased umbrella for international humanitarian organizations
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani who toured the stricken region friday also appealed for international aid
pat davis a spokesman for the american red cross in washington said friday that although the red crescent is highly organized and well equipped the large number of dead and suffering people has forced the iranian agency to solicit international assistance
the american red cross responded by mobilizing its local offices to solicit money informing its tollfree telephone operators to request earmarked donations for the earthquake victims and sending  in cash to the red crescent society to be used to help needy iranians
some jewish relief organizations found themselves in an uncomfortable position because of irans hostility toward the united states and israel
confronted with reports that iran would not welcome assistance from israel the groups were uncertain whether they should offer any assistance
andy griffel executive director of american jewish world service said directors of the assistance organization participated in a conference call friday morning to debate whether to collect money for the iranian victims
after a spirited discussion the group decided to help but to monitor the situation closely and to be prepared to change their decision
were a humanitarian organization 
without regard to political considerations griffel said
but if they are going politicize it we will definitely reconsider our participation
amir zamani a spokesman for the iranian mission at the united nations welcomed the many offers from many organizations that his office has received
iran needs assistance and such organizations are welcome to send it
acknowledging irans strained relations with many nations zamani said his country is attempting to ease the antagonism to deal with the disaster in the country
as an example he said no formalities will be required for relief planes flying into iran
he added however that aid shipments will be coordinated by the government and routed through tehran because there are no other airports in the country that can accommodate large transport planes
meanwhile other us groups were rushing to supply iran with emergency goods
dwain schenck a relief worker for americares foundation said the connecticutbased relief group expects to send  pounds of medical supplies two doctors a nurse and about half a dozen relief workers to iran today
we hope to be there about four days or so he said

tonight in the big stadium in barcelona the athletics is dominated by the four relay finals
tonight it is nation versus nation
what the relays demonstrate more clearly than any other athletics event is that at the olympics the race has traditionally gone to affluent countries  or to those rather that choose to lavish resources on athletes
the us has comfortably won the most relay medals followed by britain the former soviet union the former west germany not even counting the six won before  the former east germany france and canada
britain alone have won more relay medals  than all the caribbean islands nine and africa four including one for south africa
the dutch with one have more relay medals than all the nations of asia nil and south america nil combined
the cuban womens  metres relay teams of  and  are the only women from outside the developed world to have won relay medals
with a little luck  with their nervestretching handovers the relays always require a little luck  the developing countries will continue the gentle redistribution of medals
but although they have talent few can match the strength in depth of the traditional relay powers
the us xm squad has been weakened by the injury to danny everett
even so they rested steve lewis the m silver medallist in last nights semifinals
in the xm heats james jett replaced carl lewis but lewis ran impressively in last nights semifinal and tonight will pursue his eighth olympic gold
one thing that became clear on thursday when lewis won his seventh gold with victory in the long jump was that while winning at the olympics may bring other athletes excitement or relief lewis simply adores the experience
when voula patoulidou looking up at the giant video screen after the womens m hurdle final suddenly realised to her astonishment that she had won a gold medal she went delightfully and utterly potty as did the other  greeks in the stadium including queen sofia of spain
lewis on the other hand seemed unsurprised when mike powell was unable to overhaul him in the long jump
even though the long jump had not finished and even though m runners were trudging through a semifinal lewis began at once an extremely hammy lapandahalf of honour
he tried to orchestrate a mexican wave
this is a man who derives immense pleasure from winning in front of a packed house
lewis will be difficult to suppress tonight
noureddine morcelli of algeria will be hard to beat in the mens m
morcelli is one of five africans in the final striving to increase their continents tally of just three olympic medals all kenyan in this event
even here there is a us connection morcelli attended riverside community college in california to hone his running on good tracks
on thursday night morcelli cruised through his heat in first place after the gentlest push on the accelerator
the moroccan rachid albasir followed him down the straight a respectful step behind looming over his fellow arab and glancing anxiously round like a bodyguard
morcelli has not been beaten in the m since 
chancellor helmut kohl assured visiting us senators on the eve of a superpower summit that west germany will not forsake nato to reunite with east germany one of the senators said friday
he strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified germany be neutral sen richard g lugar head of the american delegation said of the friday meeting with kohl
asked whether he thought the west germans were committed to staying in the nato military alliance of western nations the indiana republican said without any reservations
there is growing discussion in west germany about german reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms underway in east germany
there has been speculation that west germany might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the kremlin stipulates it as the price for reunification
kohl on tuesday unveiled a point proposal with german reunification as its ultimate goal
but the soviets who suffered millions of deaths fighting a unified germany in world war ii have said the idea of german reunification is dangerous and unrealistic
president bush and soviet president mikhail s gorbachev are to begin a shipboard summit off malta on saturday
the dramatic events in east germany and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the east bloc are likely to be a main topic of their talks
lugar came to bonn with eight other members of the us senates arms control observer group
he said the purpose of the trip was to visit with the germans on their judgments about all of these procedures that are going on
us
ambassador vernon a walters joined the senators for their minute closeddoor talks with kohl
the senators also met with foreign minister hansdietrich genscher and defense minister gerhard stoltenberg during the day
lugar said kohl told the americans that reunification would be a procedure that depends on many events in germany and europe and that the soviet union and the united states have a role to play
lugar said of kohls proposals there is much to work with there with regard to the future of germany and the future of the nato alliance
administration and congressional officials agree that the cia did its job
since last week president bush had been warned by intelligence analysts that what originally looked like a military bluff was quickly turning into the kind of troop deployment that could be used to invade kuwait or even saudi arabia
central intelligence agency director william webster even handdelivered certain fresh details on the iraqi buildup to national security adviser brent scowcroft
among the assessments he conveyed was a conclusion that by this week president saddam husseins force would be capable of penetrating kuwait or saudi arabia
the agency lacked hard evidence of an intent to invade intelligence officials say
but as the buildup grew the cia became more alarmed partly because mr hussein is so unpredictable and partly because unlike many other arab leaders he has been known to carry out his threats
the hubble space telescope was awakened from its selfinduced sleep today but it was still without the use of its highspeed antennas and its science instruments were on hold unable to begin any observations
we are out of the safemode right now said steve terry a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope
he said the telescope was running on a normal controlall mode where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing
discoverys astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a return to earth sunday made some lastminute observations of earth and talked with groundbased reporters about their flight
pilot charles bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope which is expected eventually to look back  billion light years  nearly to the birth of the universe
its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the hubble space telescope said bolden
it makes little kids eyes light up
it makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science
the telescopes big eye has remained open but hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the highspeed dish antennas with a relay satellite
the antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground
terry said that even in the safe mode one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly
we expect to use that data to investigate what happened he said
engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed
were putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode in effect a standby mode he said
shortly after  am edt controllers at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a hour computer program to monitor hubbles health
it will take another day before the  billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process said hubble deputy project manager jean olivier
were backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems olivier said friday
this is not the time to do anything dumb
the telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule
landing is scheduled for  am edt sunday at edwards air force base calif but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather
winds were predicted to be about  mph with gusts up to  mph
mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed  mph at touchdown
the shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond sunday if necessary nasa said
mission control awakened the crew members at about  am edt today by playing the song cosmos
thanks for the wakeup music its pretty appropriate for today said commander loren shriver
the song was selected in honor of hubble space telescope which is now open for business said mission control commentator james hartsfield
the astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home
they also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the johnson space center
shriver and pilot charles bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttles computers and control jets were ready for return to earth
the crew deployed hubble on wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit  miles above earth
but that proved unnecessary when the door was opened friday morning exposing the telescopes finely polished inch eye to starlight for the first time
two of hubbles four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened but engineers later got them back on line
the gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that too kept the telescope in the safe mode said dave drachlis director of orbital verifications at goddard
a colleague steve terry said hubbles systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions
there also were two communications outages totaling several hours
hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods terry said
nasa had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina
but terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems
scientific data will follow in a month or two
the telescope named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble will enable astronomers over its year working lifetime to look back  billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe
the universe is believed to have been created about  billion years ago in a cosmic explosion
hubble provided the basis for the bigbang theory of creation
he discovered during the s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from earth the faster it is moving away
more than  coal miners in four states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in virginia and west virginia who have waged a bitter strike since april against the pittston coal group
miners in pennsylvania and kentucky today became the third and fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies
the sympathy strikes began monday in west virginia and spread to indiana late thursday
one united mine workers representative said today that the indiana walkout was prompted by thursday nights telecast of cbs  hours which focused on the pittston strike in which  miners have been off the job since april
pittston dropped out of the bituminous coal operators association to negotiate with the union independently and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite  months of negotiations
umw officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are responsible for the wildcat strike
some said they are asking union members to return to work but tommy buchanan international executive board member in umw district  in birmingham ala said today the final decision on whether  alabama miners will join the strike will be with union president richard trumka
it might be two days
it might be a week
it will start whenever it comes down from the union president buchanan said
union spokesman joe corcoran was not in his office and has not returned phone calls this week
the head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had no plans to confer with the pittston on the wildcat strikes
i would no more try to tell someone else how to run their company than i would expect someone else to try to tell me how to run my company said robert h quenon president of peabody holding co the nations largest coal producer and chairman of the bituminous coal operators association
quenon flew to charleston from st louis on thursday to meet with reporters and express peabodys and the associations concerns about the walkout
an estimated  united mine workers members stayed away from their jobs today in pennsylvania
most worked for rochester  pittsburgh coal co operations in central pennsylvania where  miners failed to report for work at midnight thursday said company spokesman hank waneck said
about  miners at peabodys camp no
 mine in morganfield ky didnt report for work today said company spokesman tom clarke
at least  miners were off the job at two mines in indiana today spokesmen said
mark arnold a spokesman for umw district  in terre haute attributed the action to the cbs show
when the miners saw that last night that kind of set them off to where they decided to walk out he said
about onethird of west virginias  miners were reported off the job today
some  miners in wise county va who walked out earlier in the week returned to work this morning
the coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than pittston violate a nostrike clause in the  national contract the union signed with the association
pittston did not take part in that agreement
union officials have not returned phone calls this week but in the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout
i think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadership role and do what they can to lead the miners back to work quenon said
thats why we have a union
thats why we have an agreement with the union  to set out the terms and conditions under which we will have labor to run our coal mines
and we expect that to be honored
guangzhou june  xinhua  the highest flood peaks on the xijiang and beijiang rivers have passed said zhu senlin governor of south chinas guangdong province
while inspecting flood control and relief work in qingyuan city on the beijiang river yesterday he attributed guangdongs success in combating this flood  almost the biggest in  years  to concerted efforts by the armymen stationed in guangdong and local residents
more than  people lost their lives in the natural disaster which destroyed  rooms and ruined crops on  million hectares
the flood was caused by successive torrential rainstorms in the xijiang and beijiang river valleys in early and middle june
major flood monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded their highest water levels all four meters above the danger mark
local governments at various levels in the province have paid close attention to flood control work and leading government and communist party officials of different localities have gone to the floodfighting front
no breaches of major embankments or reservoirs were reported despite the most serious flood in a hundred years effectively protecting the safety of the provincial capital guangzhou and the pearl zhujiang river delta
but the losses caused by the flood were quite serious said the governor
according to him  million people in the provinces nine cities and  counties were affected and more than  people died in the natural disaster with  rooms destroyed and  million hectares of crops ruined
the direct economic losses were set at  billion yuan
the governor warned that though the flood danger had receded the determination to fight possible further floods could not slacken as this is just the beginning the main flood season which usually begins in late july and early august has not yet arrived
he urged local officials to be on constant alert against further possible floods and be meticulous about flood prevention and control measures while doing their utmost to help flood victims assisting them to resume production as soon as possible and maintaining social stability
world leaders welcomed south africas announcement saturday of nelson r mandelas impending release from prison and international rejoicing began to build for an event so long awaited by so many
britain said it is time to resume contacts with internationally isolated south africa but antiapartheid campaigners warned against any reduction of pressure on the whiteled government
president bush praised south african president frederik w de klerk for bold and imaginative leadership and the canadian government expressed delight at the announcement that mandela would be released today
in lusaka zambian president kenneth d kaunda whose country has been a refuge for the exiled leadership of mandelas african national congress said his first reaction was to kneel down and thank god
really we must believe in the leadership of the people of south africa to put their heads together and build on these developments kaunda said
hours after the announcement of mandelas release date the ancs leadership announced from its headquarters in lusaka zambia we welcome nelson mandela back from all those years of imprisonment into our midst with great joy
ireland rejoices that nelson mandela is free at last said charles haughey irish prime minister and current president of the european community which has been using economic sanctions to pressure pretoria to give up apartheid
by his indomitable courage he has demonstrated once again that the human spirit can never be vanquished haughey said
egyptian president hosni mubarak current chairman of the organization of african unity sent mandela a message of congratulation praising the sacrifices of the great people of south africa and assuring him of egyptian solidarity with his cause
in the soviet union moscow radio broadcast news of the announcement then added nelson mandela has become the worlds most famous political prisoner put in jail for the struggle against apartheid in south africa
amsterdams central leidseplein square was temporarily rechristened nelson mandela square
in london a jubilant crowd of about  some waving pictures of mandela celebrated in the pouring rain outside south africa house in trafalgar square
in a statement released by her  downing st office prime minister margaret thatcher said we believe that the steps president de klerk has taken merit a positive practical response
we believe it no longer makes sense to discourage new investment in south africa  a restraint which in our case in any event has been voluntary  and we shall be discussing this with our ec partners she said
in  the european community banned imports of south african iron steel and kruggerand gold coins and barred new investment in the country
it had already frozen scientific and cultural relations
britain regards the iron steel and coin embargoes as mandatory but not the investment ban and has already announced that it is no longer observing the scientific and cultural embargo
in london bob hughes chairman of the antiapartheid movement said he was delighted at the news which he called a tremendous victory for the people of south africa and for the international sanctions campaign
commonwealth secretary general shridath ramphal said mandelas safety must be guaranteed by the south african government and that until change there becomes irreversible the commonwealth will sustain its pressure for the end of apartheid
it is not yet time to demobilize the international support for apartheids victims he said
writer salman rushdie who has been sentenced to die by iranian zealots has donated  to victims of last weeks devastating earthquake in iran
iran said today his death order still stands
rushdie donated the money to the independent iranian earthquake appeal organized by the independent newspaper to help survivors of the earthquake that iranian officials said left at least  people dead
i wanted to join the independent and the hostage families and many other people in their appeal for contributions toward the needs of the iranian earthquake victims rushdie said in a message delivered from his hiding place
its quite clear that at the moment we should be thinking only of the humanitarian issue which transcends all other discussion said rushdie 
the indianborn writer has been out of public view since feb   when the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini sentenced him to death for writing the satanic verses a novel many muslims regard as blasphemous
the foreign media seems to think that by publishing news of aid from salman rushdie to earthquake victims we will compromise on rushdies fatwa edict ayatollah sadeq khalkhali known as the hanging judge said in tehran
he indicated they would not
the ira bombing that killed  men and blew apart a building at the royal marines music school outraged britons and stirred recriminations over safety standards at the school
a huge explosion in a barracks staff room friday morning leveled the threestory building as bandsmen took a coffee break between practice sessions on the schools parade ground
twelve of the  people injured were hospitalized eight of them in serious condition police said
they said nine of the dead were bandsmen and one other man was not immediately identified
dozens of neighboring homes in the quiet southeastern english seaside town of deal were damaged
although trainees at the school range in age from  to  col john ware principal director of music said the slain bandsmen all were trained adult musicians
they held military ranks but none had been trained as a fighting soldier
the outlawed irish republican army engaged in a yearold campaign to drive the british from the province of northern ireland claimed responsibility in a telephone call to ireland international a dublin news agency
residents of the area adjoining the marines school said friday that despite government calls for steppedup public alertness against terrorists security at the school had eased noticeably
anyone in deal will tell you how easy it is to get into the base said fred verge a yearold army veteran
local people laid wreaths and bouquets of flowers at the entrance to the barracks
there is a great sense of anger in the community kent police chief constable paul condon said
the royal marines music school is one of  military establishments in britain that use private security firms defense ministry figures show
unidentified defense sources quoted by the times newspaper today said the civilian guards were backed up by armed marines who patrolled regularly inside the perimeter
defense secretary tom king promised a security review and said new measures had already been taken at the base
he did not elaborate
martin oneill the opposition labor partys spokesman on defense said on friday serious questions must be asked about the pennypinching policy of the ministry of defense which may well put our armed services at dreadful risk
oneill later told british broadcasting corp television the ira was prepared to take out anybody
the cowardly nature of their attacks is such that every military establishment is under threat
he said private security firms were assigned to areas considered low risks for attacks
if we designate places as being lowrisk categories then it is likely they will be attacked given the way that the ira is forced to operate oneill added
the big prizes are no longer available to them so theyre picking off the ones which they regard 
vulnerable
prime minister margaret thatcher received news of the bombing while aboard a jet over siberia en route from japan to moscow
she called it a deeply serious outrage
king visited the scene soon after the explosion
i know that the people who committed it the godfathers who sent them actually know in their hearts that it is not going to make any difference that it is just killing for the sake of killing he said
the defense minister anger clearly written on his face said that rather than erode the will of the security forces the attack redoubles their determination to ensure that terrorism cannot win
prime minister charles haughey of ireland condemned the attack and sent mrs thatcher a message of sympathy at this outrage  which has caused severe and tragic loss of life and many injuries
the mainly roman catholic ira claim gave no details of the operation but said it was a response to a message of war delivered by mrs thatcher when she visited northern ireland nine days ago
it was an apparent reference to her speech praising the locally recruited ulster defense regiment as a very very brave group of men who have lost  members in ira attacks since 
the mainly protestant udr is regarded by many catholics as a sectarian force and is at present under a cloud over allegations that some recruits leaked names addresses and photos of ira suspects to protestant assassins
british military installations are a frequent target of the ira campaign

us cities along the gulf of mexico from alabama to eastern texas were on storm watch last night as hurricane andrew headed west after sweeping across southern florida causing at least eight deaths and severe property damage
the hurricane was one of the fiercest in the us in decades and the first to hit miami directly in a quarter of a century
in the bahamas government spokesman mr jimmy curry said four deaths had been reported on outlying eastern islands
mr justin balcombe of ukbased insurance adjuster balcombe group said total losses could exceed dollars bn if business interruption claims were taken into account
that compares with the dollars bndollars n pounds bnpounds bn of insurance industry losses caused by the last big us hurricane hugo which hit south carolina in 
the brunt of the losses are likely to be concentrated among us insurers industry analysts said yesterday
mr george lloydroberts chairman of lloyds underwriters nonmarine association said that unless damage claims exceeded pounds bn the lloyds insurance market would feel little impact
because the reinsurance of reinsurance risk  known as the retrocession market  has shrunk considerably in recent years us insurers have placed far fewer of their risks through lloyds
mr roger hill insurance analyst at warburg securities said he estimated that mainline uk insurers faced no more than pounds m in damage claims so far
at the moment we are relaxed about it he said
the real question he added is the level of reinsurance available to the uk underwriters
royal insurance estimated the companys losses at no more than pounds m
among other uk insurers mr hill estimated that general accident may face losses of up to pounds m while guardian royal exchange faced pounds m and sun alliance and commercial union pounds m each
however hurricane andrew gathered fresh strength as it moved across the gulf of mexico and there was concern last night that it might head towards new orleans which is especially low lying and could suffer severe flood damage
scientists said the storm could make landfall anywhere between the alabama port of mobile and the louisianatexas border probably tomorrow night or early thursday
it could threaten the large concentration of offshore oil production facilities in the gulf of mexico
shell oil was evacuating most of the  workers on its offshore platforms as a precaution
a substantial part of americas oil refining industry is concentrated on the gulf coast in louisiana and texas and officials there were reviewing emergency plans to curtail or shut down plant operations
andrew the first caribbean hurricane of the season hit the eastern coast of florida early yesterday gusting up to mph
it ripped roofs off houses smashed cars and trucks snapped power lines and uprooted trees before heading out over the gulf
a million people had been ordered to flee their homes in southern florida as the hurricane moved in from the bahamas on sunday
the florida power and light company said that about m of its customers or  per cent were without power
some of the strongest winds were in the affluent suburb of coral gables just south of miami where the national hurricane center is located
its radar and satellite antennae were blown away
president bush authorised federal disaster assistance for the affected areas and made plans for an inspection tour of the state

tokyo ap  emperor hirohito will be remembered for one overwhelming decision during his year reign japan must bow to defeat for the first time in its history and end the pacific conflict in world war ii
shortly after that decision and for most of his reign hirohito became a figurehead isolated from his subjects by tradition and steeped in his great love the study of marine biology
he was the last survivor among the national leaders of the world war ii era
but in his first  years the son of heaven was worshiped as a divinity descended from the sun goddess amaterasu
the solitude of animal and plant life under the seas which so intrigued hirohito was in keeping with the character of the man who became the th occupant of the chrysanthemum throne at the age of  on christmas day  designating his reign showa  enlightened peace
the emperor was generally portrayed as having played no significant role in planning or carrying out japans military adventures in the s and s
but it was his first effective decision as emperor and his most courageous that ended the pacific conflict
on aug   four days after historys first atomic bomb devastated hiroshima and one day after a us bomber dropped the second atomic bomb on nagasaki the generals and admirals of imperial japans wartime government argued for hours in the sweltering bombproof shelter beneath the tokyo palace
should japan agree to the allies surrender demand or fight on until annihilation
speaking in what some of those present described as a slow and obviously nervous monotone hirohito the spiritual and titular leader offered his opinion for the first time
he spoke of his sorrow over the soldiers and sailors killed in the long war and of families who lost everything in air raids
i cannot bear to see my innocent people suffer any longer he said
ending the war is the only way to restore world peace and to relieve the nation from the terrible distress with which it is burdened
then evoking a memory of his grandfather the emperor meiji whose reign  saw the end of  years of feudal japanese isolation from the outside world hirohito told the officers the time has come when we must bear the unbearable
in the days that followed hirohito continued his break with tradition
in a national radio broadcast aug   the first time ordinary japanese ever actually heard his voice  he personally announced the decision to surrender
he told the ravaged nation that the war situation has developed not necessarily to our advantage
three weeks later hirohito donned a silk cutaway coat striped trousers and a top hat to meet the allied commander gen douglas a macarthur at the us embassy in tokyo
it was the first time hirohito had ever gone to see anyone and the first of several calls on the general who had led the pacific war against japan and became its postwar governor
on new years day  at macarthurs insistence the emperor publicly renounced his divinity
it was a choice that enabled hirohito to remain as the symbolic head of his nation and assured that he would not face charges as a war criminal as some abroad had demanded
it also was an act that seemed to relieve no one as much as this gentle shy and retiring man who never seemed very comfortable as a living god
the emperors status in the eyes of many japanese changed to that of a kind uncle
he became a widely respected authority on marine biology
he possessed rare collections of marine life discovered several species himself and wrote or coauthored at least  books on hydrozoa or sea animals his specialty
in recent years his life had become the subject of a popular comic book series
still hirohito and the imperial system remained important to japan
a nationwide survey by the daily newspaper mainichi shimbun in march  indicated more than  percent of  people polled supported the imperial system while only  percent said it should be abolished
five percent said the emperor should have more power
from  to  hirohito toured japan to encourage the people to rebuild
the imperial household agency which ran his affairs said hirohito considered the postwar period one of the most fulfilling times of his life in which the nation made a phenomenal recovery from a war that cost  million japanese lives
despite the humanization of the imperial family hirohito remained under strict control of the imperial household agency
protocol was maintained at nearly all times and he was prohibited from speaking on any controversial subject
hirohito was born on april  
in accordance with ageold imperial custom he was taken from his parents as an infant to be reared in isolation by household functionaries and trained for one role that of emperor
his education came as japan surged into the modern world
the feudal samurai ethic was still strong when his grandfather died gen maresuke nogi the mentor for the yearold prince calmly committed ritual suicide to follow the emperor his master to the grave
hirohito studied government and law with private tutors
when he was  his father emperor taisho sent him abroad  the first time any member of the immediate imperial family was allowed outside japan
hirohito visited england scotland france belgium the netherlands and italy receiving various decorations
he was also received by pope benedict xv
the young man handled money for the first time paying his own fare on the paris subway
he developed a passion for bacon and eggs and it became a lifelong breakfast habit
a palace chamberlain said in a  interview that hirohito shunned japanese food unless it is forced on him by an unwitting host
hirohito also acquired a preference for western clothes
he was never seen in public wearing traditional japanese garb and a palace official confided that the emperor of japan did not even own a kimono
hirohito became prince regent on nov   after his father became a mental and physical invalid became emperor five years later and was formally enthroned in 
dan quayle has not yet been nominated for vice president and already republicans are comparing him to thomas jefferson and john f kennedy
sen john warner of virginia who served with quayle on a senate subcommittee told an audience that whenever he heard the indiana senator speak id say there stands the next thomas jefferson
and added warner he does have the same fire in his belly as our great forefather thomas jefferson of virginia
former president gerald ford made the comparison with kennedy a democrat
in  the american people voted for john f kennedy for president and he was the relatively same age as dan quayle said ford
john kennedy had been in the house and senate  years before he was elected president and dan quayles had  years
what quayle thinks of those references isnt known
but he doesnt like it when people say he looks like movie idol robert redford
whether indeed he looks like redford seems to be in the eye of the beholder
in the parlance of politics its an issue
they are both male
they are both blond
the socalled resemblance became a point of contention in the  senate race and redford took umbrage
the actor who once played the role of a presidential office seeker in the candidate sent quayle a telegram telling him to stop the lookalike references in his congressional campaign literature
quayle said the news media had made the comparison not he and after he was elected sent redford an autographed picture of himself
and this week he told reporters he considered the socalled redford look a stigma
he wasnt asked how he felt about being painted as another jefferson or kennedy
meanwhile fellow senators were trying to publicize quayle who at  hasnt had a chance to become a legend
he is a republican vice presidential candidate who is not as spiro agnew once said of himself a household word
to help him get known eight fellow senators wednesday took turns telling reporters how much they liked him
we know him well said strom thurmond rsc hes attractive because of his looks hes attractive because of his enthusiasm said sen john mccain rariz i think dan quayle although hes  years of age hes going to send a message to the american people that the republican party respects young people who achieve said sen pete domenici rnm oh yes hes also rich but the senators said that should not hold him back
lets not start this business of whos wealthy sen alfonse damato rny
gov
george deukmejian is right to call the legislature into special session within the next two weeks to deal with the effects of last tuesdays northern california earthquake
with congress already moving to grant up to  billion in relief earthquake victims need to know that state officials are prepared to come up with the states share of disaster and reconstruction aid as soon as possible and as soon as is practical
deukmejian should be commended as well for advising state officials to do all they can to expedite aid to earthquake victims without getting too tangled up in red tape
the governor is wrong however in his campaign to distance himself from the california department of transportation on the issue of what caused the nimitz freeway in oakland to collapse and what could or should have been done to have prevented it
while deukmejian is not necessarily blaming caltrans he seems to be preparing himself for such investigatory questions as what did you know and when did you know it
the governors answer which he has been repeating ever since the day of the quake was that no one in caltrans ever told him a freeway might collapse in an earthquake
he was shocked that such a thing would happen
this has the earmarks of a preemptive defense against any allegation that california stinted on highway reinforcement because transportation funds have been short during his administration possibly because he had opposed a gasoline tax increase
there is keen interest of course in why the freeway collapsed and whether something might have been done
the major reason is so that california can learn from the experience as it designs new roads and reinforces existing ones against the next quake
there has been no widespread outcry against the governor
while the department of transportation and the state transportation commission do exercise considerable control over the allocation of highway funds the governor also sets general state priorities
the governor complained on sunday that the highway engineers never came to him and told him that bridges or freeways might collapse in an earthquake
but no one who has lived in california more than a few months would rule out the chance that any bridge or freeway could collapse in the right kind of earthquake
california is on the edge of earthquakerelated technology but still does not know everything that needs to be known
the state learns more from every earthquake and a critical need now is to learn everything possible from tuesday oct 
but it is also the time to concentrate on helping quake victims through these most trying days of their experience  the period when the emergency response is over and people face the dreary details of restoring their life to some kind of normality
in the bay area that includes hundreds of thousands of commuters who did not suffer personal damage but face massive obstacles in getting to work
the governor and legislative leaders will meet again next monday to determine the timing and agenda of a special session
it almost certainly would include a temporary gasolinetax increase to deal with highway reconstruction and repair and possible general revenues for other forms of disaster relief
existing law already gives the governor considerable discretion in diverting reserve funds on hand to the office of emergency services for allocation to local governments
but the need could well exceed the present reserve
the scope of the disaster would seem to justify a temporary surcharge
the governor and legislature should not wait too long to start the session although they do not yet have precise damage estimates or know just how much the federal government will send to california
the legislature can begin organizing its staff and committees now so the appropriate legislation can be passed as soon as that information is obtained

bfn donetsk oblast no date as received  as unian reported miners at the ordzhonikidzevuhillya coal production association and the yenakiyevo and poltava pits went on strike in yenakiyevo on  june demanding payment of wage arrears
the strike continued at these mines on  june
some of the miners at the karl marx chernovonyy zhovten chervonyy profinter and yunkom pits joined the strike
a total of  of the associations  workers are on strike
a rally consisting of  miners was held on  june near the town council building where demands were made to pay the wages and dismiss the director general of the ordzhonikidzevuhillya production association
a strike committee consisting of  persons was elected one of the members is a former komsomol leader and former ussr peoples deputy viktor honcharov and it was decided to continue the strike until the demands that had been raised have been completely fulfilled
on  june  of  workers on the second shift at the pivdennodonbass mine of the donetskvuhillya production association in the town of ugledar refused to start work for the same reasons  delay in paying wages
after a meeting with the mines director who promised to pay the arrears the miners on the third shift returned to work
on  june all miners on the fourth shift at the karbomid and pervomaysk mines in pervomaysk lugansk oblast refused to start work  and  miners respectively

the new us ambassador to jordan wesley egan is a heavyweight
once the second man in the us embassy in cairo he also served in saudi arabia two african countries and a european nation
his choice for the new job signals the importance the united states attaches to jordan in terms of interarab politics and the arabisraeli dispute
before egans appointment became final he had to go through a grueling test in the us senate where senator daniel moynihan the zionist democrat from new york presided over the hearing that scrutinized the wouldbe ambassadors credentials and went on to confirm his nomination
in his testimony egan told the hearing he would work to develop relations between the united states and jordan and enhance jordans role in the peace process
he pointed out that jordan signed a joint agenda with israel that will presumably culminate in a peace treaty between the two countries
his said his top priority in amman will be to propel the peace process forward and recognize jordans energetic role in the effort to bring about a comprehensive middle east peace
mr egan will pay special attention to stability in jordan and watch its democratic march and economic development
he will also watch jordans approach to a number of other issues human rights compliance with the sanctions resolution against iraq terminating the boycott of us companies doing business with israel the potential for foreign investment both in jordan and elsewhere in the region and the fight against terrorism
much as i take exception to some of the issues that will engage the new ambassadors attention i concern myself here with a lecture moynihan delivered at the confirmation hearing
discussing the west bank and gaza he dismissed as inappropriate the designation attached to them as occupied territories and asked if these are occupied territories who were they occupied by
these territories contended the senator were never the sovereign domain of anyone it was jordan that occupied the west bank at the founding of the state of israel
what israel did was to take the west bank from jordan the way it took gaza from egypt
previously these territories were part of the british mandate and before that they fell within the realm of the ottoman empire
mr moynihans point in other words is that these territories are up for grabs
the united states he noted never recognized jordans sovereignty over the west bank
his bottom line israel did not occupy territory that was under another nations sovereignty
this zionist senators remarks are not supposed to be washingtons official line
however they do mirror an undeclared us line dictated by the allpowerful zionist lobby  a line that is now all but declared with the bizarre voting stance of the united states toward the un security council resolution condemning the hebron massacre
who could possibly regard her as anything other than a crackpot and a public menace
 well lets see theres party rockers the bs and cult singer lene lovich  successful critically acclaimed musicians who credit onos music as an influence
theres the whitney museum of art which exhibited onos artwork last year  one of the  museum shows she has had around the world
 theres also the american film institute which ono says is staging an international tour of her experimental films
and onos record label  they want to put out all my songs in a kind of cd box or something ono says
 surprised
sos ono
shes used to rougher treatment
acceptance is a difficult concept for her
 im used to sort of knocking the door rather than having the door opened and having to cope with entering it ono says during a telephone interview
 shes speaking from the new york office of bag one arts the company ono founded to promote lennons art and image
 marketing an icon since his death in  ono has steadily kept lennon products coming out the albums milk and honey and menlove avenue and the cd boxed set the john lennon collection the book skywriting by word of mouth a collection of lennons unpublished writings lennons art which ono says was his main interest in his final years and lennoninspired merchandise such as a line of john lennon eyeglasses
 i told the fans that im going to do  years of it
every year hopefully give a new product and share it with the fans ono says
some years we had two or three products of john that came out
 the year promise ended with last years yearlong celebration of lennons th birthday
in  ono says she has tried to relax a little and do my own stuff
 ono  has been going into a recording studio every day to work on the proposed boxedset of her music
she continues to produce art and recently had a museum exhibit in iceland
 ono began her art career as an abstract impressionist then went avantgarde
she began doing performance art in the early s long before the form was legitimized by art critics and government grants
 a life in two worlds ono declines to put a label on her current works
she says thats for the critics to decide
i just like to create she says
 ono still lives in the dakota apartment house in new york the site of lennons murder by a crazed fan
 on dec   the couple was returning home from the recording studio where they had been remixing walking on thin ice one of the songs that would appear on onos most successful album season of glass
as they approached the entrance to the building someone called out mr
lennon
lennon turned and mark david chapman shot him five times with a  revolver
 after lennons death there was speculation that ono would leave the united states forever
she did begin living parttime in geneva
 my theory was that i would live more and more in geneva ono says
but it seems like circumstances are making me come back more and more to new york
this is my hometown thats how i feel about it
its a place where i can work very well
 ono was born in tokyo  her name means ocean child  and came with her family to the united states in 
ono lived with her family in san francisco and new york until the japanese attack of pearl harbor forced them to return home
 in  the onos returned to new york
yoko married a japanese composer when she was 
the marriage lasted seven years
ono married a second time in  to avantgarde artist tony cox
the couple had one child a daughter named kyoko
in  ono and lennon met
he too was married and had a child julian
ono and lennon were married in  there has been much speculation on ono and lennons relationship
some say she controlled him
john was an extremely strong person ono says
there was no way to dominate him even if i wanted to
 others say lennon used his relationship with ono as an escape from things in his life that he felt were controlling him  such as the beatles
 in may  when the beatles came together at the studio to work on the beatles the tworecord set commonly called the white album ono was at lennons side
the two were inseparable
according to at least one beatles biographer ono even accompanied lennon on trips to the bathroom
 the relationship between the beatles  especially lennon and paul mccartney  was already strained
having ono in the studio offering suggestions and backing lennon up in arguments didnt help
 still the group already seemed headed toward a breakup which finally came when mccartney sued the other beatles to resolve an argument over the groups management
so no ono didnt break up the beatles
but its also true that three of them didnt like her much
 life after john i think the very fact that john and i got together hurt them a lot she says
we hurt them and they hurt us
i cant really say its a onesided situation
 ono says she feels no bitterness toward the surviving beatles
 songwriters in this world are pretty harmless people she says
theyre not doing anything like creating a nuclear bomb or trying to decide whether people should be killed
theyre pretty peaceful people and their songs will hopefully inspire people
i have a lot of respect for them
 but how do the beatles feel toward ono these days
 it varies she says
sometimes they are friendly sometimes they are not 
like all relationships with friends
i think thats natural
 many of the books that have been written about lennon and the beatles especially albert goldmans loathing portrait of lennon have been painful to ono
but she says she isnt sure about writing her own version
 i was hurt very much and my son too by some of the things that were written she says
they were lies and thats what hurt us
 then again when i think of writing my true story 
i could say this is the truth and write about things somebody did or whatever but then i think about their children
if you look at it from the big picture maybe there was not such an incredible crime done to me
two writs have been filed alleging that goldman sachs the usbased investment bank assisted in diverting pounds m from two pension schemes controlled by robert maxwell to ensure its own debts from maxwell interests would be repaid
the writs were filed late last week in the state supreme court in manhattan by trustees for mirror group newspapers pension scheme and maxwell communication corporation works pension scheme
the trustees seek more than dollars m for the sale of shares plus interest commission charges and punitive damages from goldman and mr eric sheinberg partner in charge of international equities trading
the writs centre on the purchase of pounds m of mcc shares from the pension schemes by two swiss trusts servex and yakosa which were transacted through goldman and for which the schemes were never paid
the writs allege goldman was aware the trusts were controlled by robert maxwell
the writs also allege that on may    the same date mr kevin maxwell arranged for the pension fund share transaction to be paid for  goldman was due to receive dollars m for an unrelated transaction selling mcc stock to an unnamed american lawyer with close connections to robert maxwell
the writs claim that goldman was competing directly with its customer the pension fund trustee for payment
on april   they say mr kevin maxwell told mr sheinberg to sell the pension scheme shares to the swiss trusts
on may  he told goldman to remit the proceeds of the sale not to the pension schemes but to bishopsgate investment trust which goldman knew or should have known was controlled by the maxwell family
the writs allege that after the deal was struck mr trevor cook mgn pension fund administrator told goldman that proceeds of the sale should be paid to the pension scheme but when mr kevin maxwell ordered the proceeds to be paid to bit
the writs say that goldman and sheinberg made no reasonable effort to determine who had actual authority to direct for the pension fund that the shares be sold and where the more than dollars m in proceeds from the transfer of the m shares should go
goldman said it had received no money or other benefit from these transactions other than its brokerage commissions of pounds  which were substantially less than the amount of the applicable stamp duties paid to the inland revenue of pounds

 he was larger than life 
the citizen kane of his time said british conservative party lawmaker anthony beaumontdark referring to orson welles classic movie about a publishing baron presumed to have been william randolph hearst

mr kelley is in training for the boston marathon  his th boston marathon
and even at the age of  he probably will finish ahead of a large number of the  runners expected to compete  officially or unofficially  on april 
bill rodgers a fourtime boston marathon winner who plans to run again this year marvels at mr kelley its incomprehensible that a man his age is doing what hes doing
im struggling at the age of  
this isnt golf
even the thought of running a course of  miles and  yards leaves some of mr kelleys rivals of yesteryear gasping
aghast is more like it says leslie pawson  a threetime boston champion who ran against mr kelley half a century ago
my doctor says no running whatsoever
i cant even remember when i ran my last marathon
john adelbert kelley is a throwback to a time when marathoners did it for glory and cab fare
a twotime winner in boston  and  and runnerup seven times mr kelley is to be the oldest competitor in the race this year  as he has been for  years
mr kelley is such an institution that hopkinton mass where the race begins has made him an honorary citizen
that means i dont have to pay taxes there he jokes
two state troopers will run alongside the foot pound mr kelley into boston so he wont be trampled by groupies as he calls them clamoring to shake his hand
last year five japanese runners were waved away by the bodyguards as they sidled up to the old celebrity during the race
recalls suni tomomitsu one of the runners at first we thought oh wow hes like mafia man
then we said oh no this is nice johnny kelley
in japan he is awesome
though he isnt the oldest person ever to enter the boston marathon mr kelley is the oldest to run it
peter foley who was born in  was a regular until he was well into his s
but he walked the course
starting at dawn six hours before the official noon start mr foley would eventually saunter across the finish line in the moonlight
of course mr kelley  not to be confused with the other john kelley who won the boston marathon in   isnt the runner he was in  when he won the race in  hours  minutes  seconds
his best time ever was in   hours  minutes  seconds
last year he finished in  hours  minutes
he hopes to do better in 
thats not a prediction just a goal he says
when john kelley first toed the line in  george bush wasnt yet in kindergarten joe dimaggio was an unknown and nike was the winged goddess of victory not a running shoe
in those days mr kelley recalls he ran in black leather highjumping shoes that he cut open at the toes with a razor blade
i would have loved to run with the worst pair of sneakers on the market today he says
back then the sport didnt have much of a following
today of course the boston marathon is a big deal covered by tv from start to finish and offering  altogether in prize money
the winners get a medal and  says mr kelley
i got a medal and beef stew
god bless them he adds
they deserve it
the rosycheeked supple mr kelley is a medical wonder
each year he visits the cooper clinic at the aerobics center in dallas for a battery of endurance tests
physiologically whatever that means i got all as mr kelley reports of his checkup four months ago
what that means explains kenneth cooper the physician who wrote aerobics and several sequels and is now at work on a book on elderly athletes is that johnny has the body of a man  years younger
hes going to be one of the stars of my book
mr kelleys resting pulse rate   beats a minute  is well below the average persons  beats
thats good
on the stress test the clinic gives mr kelley holds the endurance record for his age group
a mechanic for boston edison co before he retired in  mr kelley started running in the evenings after work more than six decades ago
his only purpose was to relax and have some fun
all day long i did what my boss told me to do he recalls
but when i ran at night i felt free
i ran till i was exhausted
in  when he was  he entered his first boston marathon but didnt finish
he dropped out threequarters of the way through the race
then in  he finished th in a field of about  runners
in all the years since he has missed the race just once in 
he has competed all told in  marathons including the  and  olympics
mr kelley well knows the jagged course from hopkinton to downtown boston the first challenge comes five miles into the race where a set of little hills can get a psyched runner to waste energy charging up the slopes
a mile and a half later theres new reason to beware the smells of cavanaughs bakery can set off hunger pangs
an exxon station in wellesley marks the halfway point
a steep descent into newton lower falls can jar a tired runners bones
then at the end of a long column of oak and maple trees is heartbreak hill his nemesis
it cost him at least two victories he says
and finally theres the haunted mile a stretch where many runners have collapsed
bostons skyline   miles in the distance can seem so far away
though still going strong mr kelley acknowledges the marathon gets tougher each year
to compensate he trains harder
he used to start preparing in earnest at the end of january
in recent years ive been in training  months a year he says though the serious stuff  a daily onehour run sprints on the track and long  hour runs every other week  begins in december
he doesnt count the miles he puts in as many longdistance runners obsessively do but he says he wouldnt object to an estimate of about  miles a week
mr kelley always trains at  am and alone its a quiet time no traffic the air is fresh and sweet
his routes vary
in january he prefers the frozen sands of the beach
with the approach of spring he takes to the alder and scrubpine hills and bluffs where the sun can be seen rising over cape cod bay
after his morning run he spends a couple of hours painting still lifes and cape cod scenes a hobby he took up about  years ago
unlike many runners mr kelley doesnt bother with stretching exercises before he runs in the morning
this is my warm up i empty the dishwasher i set up the coffeepot but i dont plug it in
i set up the breakfast table
then i check the outside temperature to see what clothes to wear
he and his wife laura live in a twobedroom ranchstyle house here in east dennis with more than  trophies medals and sweatstained marathon numbers scattered about
he isnt particular about brands of shoes i wear them all or what he eats i never eat broccoli but i love steak and ice cream
mr kelley aims to run till he is at least  years old
hes a strange man says laura kelley in awe of her husbands vigor
the yearold mrs kelley adds i just try to stay in his shadow but i have a hard time even doing that
in a rare moment of reflection mr kelley explains what makes him tick i paint because i like it
i run because i like it
if for some reason i dont finish the marathon i dont owe an apology to anyone
but ill tell you the boston marathon  with all those people waving  is better than my birthday

that involvement he said might affect her husbands handling of religiousliberty cases if he shares her views on the subject
 during the early s virginia thomas enrolled in lifespring a selfhelp course that challenges students to take responsibility for their lives
she was troubled by some of the activities and eventually broke with the organization
since  she has been a public advocate against cult activities
 when she served as a laborrelations attorney at the us chamber of commerce from  to  she represented the interests of the business community at congressional hearings on such issues as comparable worth affirmative action and federal childcare legislation

mrs quayle personally thanked workers cleaning up the debris left by wednesdays twister and visited some of the injured at crestwood hospital during her hour tour
the tornado left  people dead hundreds injured and up to  homeless

guy hunt and us sens
howell heflin and richard shelby
mrs quayle who made similar visits to san francisco after the oct  earthquake and charleston sc after hurricane hugo also praised corporations that have made donations to help huntsville recover
federal and state officials have promised to do whatever is necessary to help huntsville even if disaster relief funds are squeezed by hurricane hugo and the quake
were here to get the job done grant peterson associate director of the federal emergency management agency said friday
whatevers needed will be done
president bush declared huntsville a disaster area but fema may have to do some financial juggling to deal with this years rash of natural disasters
parts of eight states have been declared eligible for federal relief
any one disaster like hugo or the earthquake in california exceeds  what we have in a normal year alone peterson said
congress provided  billion in supplemental funds to fema after hugo devastated the caribbean and the east coast in september and  billion following the earthquake that ravaged parts of northern california on oct 
so far about  billion has been allocated to disaster victims
peterson said hes not yet concerned about fema meeting its financial obligations
i would say that to ask for any more money at this point would be premature he said
peterson and his aides urged patience during the arduous task of processing thousands of relief requests from the huntsville area
if everything works well in seven to  days we should get the first checks out peterson said friday
ill make sure that we expedite these requests to meet the peoples needs
the state will have to ante up  percent of the cost of providing clothing and temporary housing for tornado victims with the federal government pitching in the other  percent

moldavia acting to defuse one of the soviet unions most explosive ethnic conflicts agreed sunday to comply with a kremlin order to reconsider its law making moldavian the republics official language
the republics parliament acted in response to a decree issued on dec  by president mikhail s gorbachev the official news agency tass reported
gorbachev also gave the republic  days to dissolve a new national guard and to come up with measures guaranteeing equal rights for all ethnic groups within its borders
tass said the moldavan parliament agreed to disband the nationalguard and to revise a law that gorbachev said restricted the rights of minorities
ethnic tension has gripped moldavia a largely agricultural republic bordering romania during its push for independence from the soviet union this year
the unrest turned violent last month when government troops clashed with activists leaving four dead
gorbachev said the conflicts had reached critical levels and he put part of the blame on the moldavian supreme soviet for enacting laws that discriminate against minorities
alarmed by rising moldavian nationalism two of the republics minority groups have begun their own separatist movements
the gagauz a group of about  turkish christians declared a new republic in southern moldavia
in the eastern part of moldavia more than  ethnic russians and ukrainians have joined in declaring a new republic along the dneister river
all three groups claim discrimination by moldavians
in particular they resent a new law making moldavian the official language and requiring people in dozens of jobs ranging from doctors to hairdressers to pass moldavian language tests by 
tass did not say how the moldavian parliament would modify the law
moldavian is identical to romanian except for the cyrillic script josef stalin imposed on the republic
it is spoken by twothirds of the republics residents
soviet hardliners want gorbachev to impose a state of emergency and presidential rule in troubled zones throughout the ethnically and geographically diverse country
gorbachev said the declaration of the gagauz and dniester republics was illegal under the soviet and moldavian constitutions as were elections to form legislatures and any actions by those bodies
the moldavian legislature has also voted to declare the elections null and void
after residents of the gagauz region began holding local elections in late october the moldavian legislature clamped a twomonth state of emergency on the region restricting movement in and out of the area and banning public rallies
volunteer brigades of collegeage moldavians who then flocked to the region to try to stop the separatist movement were ordered dissolved by gorbachevs decree
the volunteers were organized by nationalist groups including the moldavian peoples front
hurricane gilbert packing  mph winds and torrential rain moved over this capital city today after skirting puerto rico haiti and the dominican republic
there were no immediate reports of casualties
telephone communications were affected
right now its actually moving over jamaica said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in miami
weve already had reports of  mph winds on the eastern tip
it looks like the eye is going to move lengthwise across that island and theyre going to bear the full brunt of this powerful hurricane sheets said
forecasters say gilbert was expected to lash jamaica throughout the day and was on track to later strike the cayman islands a small british dependency northwest of jamaica
meanwhile havana radio reported today that  people were evacuated from guantanamo province on cubas southeastern coast as strong winds fanning out from gilbert began brushing the island
all jamaicabound flights were canceled at miami international airport while flights from grand cayman the main island of the threeisland chain arrived packed with frightened travelers
people were running around in the main lobby of our hotel on grand cayman like chickens with their heads cut off said one vacationer who was returning home to california through miami
hurricane warnings were posted for the cayman islands cuba and haiti
warnings were discontinued for the dominican republic
all interests in the western caribbean should continue to monitor the progress of this dangerous hurricane the service said adding little change in strength is expected for the next several hours as the hurricane moves westward over jamaica
the associated press caribbean headquarters in san juan puerto rico was unable to get phone calls through to kingston where high winds and heavy rain preceding the storm drenched the capital overnight toppling trees causing local flooding and littering streets with branches
most jamaicans stayed home boarding up windows in preparation for the hurricane
some companies broadcast appeals for technicians and electricians to report to work
the weather bureau predicted gilberts center  miles southeast of kingston before dawn would pass south of kingston and hit the southern parish of clarendon
flash flood warnings were issued for the parishes of portland on the northeast and st mary on the north
the north coast tourist region from montego bay on the west and ocho rios on the east far from the southern impact zone and separated by mountains was expected only to receive heavy rain
officials urged residents in the higher risk areas along the south coast to seek higher ground
its certainly one of the larger systems weve seen in the caribbean for a long time said hal gerrish forecaster at the national hurricane center
forecasters at the center said the eye of gilbert was  miles southeast of kingston at dawn today
maximum sustained winds were near  mph with tropicalstorm force winds extending up to  miles to the north and  miles to the south
prime minister edward seaga of jamaica alerted all government agencies saying sunday night hurricane gilbert appears to be a real threat and everyone should follow the instructions and hurricane precautions issued by the office of disaster preparedness in order to minimize the danger
forecasters said the hurricane had been gaining strength as it passed over the ocean after it dumped  to  inches of rain on the dominican republic and haiti which share the island of hispaniola
we should know within about  hours whether its going to be a major threat to the united states said martin nelson another meteorologist at the center
its moving at about  mph to the west and normally hurricanes take a northward turn after they pass central cuba
cubas official prensa latina news agency said a state of alert was declared at midday in the cuban provinces of guantanamo holguin santiago de cuba and granma
in the report from havana received in mexico city prensa latina said civil defense officials were broadcasting bulletins on national radio and television recommending emergency measures and providing information on the storm
heavy rain and stiff winds downed power lines and caused flooding in the dominican republic on sunday night as the hurricanes center passed just south of the barahona peninsula then less than  miles from neighboring haiti
the storm ripped the roofs off houses and flooded coastal areas of southwestern puerto rico after reaching hurricane strength off the islands southeast saturday night
flights were canceled sunday in the dominican republic where civil defense director eugenio cabral reported some flooding in parts of the capital of santo domingo and power outages there and in other southern areas
the death toll from flash floods that swept through a rural area of eastern ohio rose to  sunday as searchers dug along two creeks and dived into the ohio river
sixteen people remained missing
workers used shovels and picks to dig along the creek banks and sifted through debris at places marked with red flags where search dogs indicated theyd detected human scents said national guard capt
jim boling
divers worked where the two creeks empty into the ohio
four bodies were found sunday
but two of those were not immediately identified and the list of missing was not revised to account for them
the number missing dropped to  with the other two bodies and the removal of two other names a woman who called to say she was safe and a person who authorities werent sure lived in the area said coroners investigator chuck vogt
the th victim was pulled from the mouth of pipe creek at the ohio river about seven miles south of shadyside vogt said
another body was found in debris along wegee creek and two bodies were found earlier in the ohio he said
that brought the confirmed death toll in thursdays floods to  including five children
twentythree dog teams from four states were searching for victims said boling
the digging will continue at least through tuesday said fire chief mark badia
the thing you find once you start into these brush piles and piles of trees are cars and they have to be torn apart and searched separately badia said
everything you turn up creates a different situation
but vogt said he doubted many of the missing would be found alive
its just been too long
i dont think theres anybody alive out there he said
you cant swim out there that long in the ohio river
the wegee and pipe creeks overflowed thursday night during storms that poured  inches of rain onto eastern ohio in  hours
the floods destroyed as many as  houses and damaged up to  others
authorities said friday that  people were missing some of those were later found dead while others notified authorities that they were safe
officials also learned that some of those feared missing had moved out of the area
officials were comparing county property lists and data from the census bureau with information from residents and relatives boling said
investigators sunday blamed the flash floods on an unusually heavy rainstorm that overwhelmed the designed flow capacities of threebridges over the creeks
badia said rainwater running down hillsides forced debris into the creeks forming dams at each bridge
the dams broke under the water pressure
eventually the bridges couldnt hold any more
the debris broke loose and thats when we got three big gushes of water he said
as rescue efforts continued the national guard cleared roads and bridges leading into the stricken area
eighteen ohio counties have been declared federal disaster areas since tornadoes and flooding first struck may 
across the border in west virginia gov
gaston caperton said sunday he had no precise dollar figure on damage from flooding friday along a fivemile stretch near new martinsville and in nearby ohio county but estimated it will run into millions of dollars
no deaths or serious injuries were reported
caperton toured flooded areas in wheeling and the doolin run community near new martinsville
he said he saw tremendous devastation to hundreds of houses house trailers and cars
state public safety secretary joseph skaff estimated that repairing and replaceing bridges and roads will cost about

coal miners in siberia ended their strike today after exacting promises of better food housing and working conditions but the wave of unrest they launched continued in other key coal regions
some of the  miners who went on strike last week in siberias kuznetsk coal basin region returned to work thursday and the rest went back today strike leaders and the official tass news agency said
despite announcements that president mikhail s gorbachevs sweeping concessions  including granting miners greater control over their industry  apply nationwide hundreds of thousands of miners stayed off the job elsewhere
in the largest coal region the donetsk coal basin of the ukraine more than  miners were on strike the deputy minister of the coal industry alexander p fisun told izvestia
in the karaganda region of the southern republic of kazakhstan the soviet unions thirdbiggest coalproducing area all  mines were at a standstill and miners made more than  demands izvestia said
strikes were also reported in the pechora coal basin in the russian republic and chervonograd in the western ukraine official media said
the labor unrest is the soviet unions worst in six decades
gorbachev has expressed sympathy for the strikers and placed much of the blame for the miners deteriorating working and living conditions on leaders of the officially sanctioned trade unions
still he and other communist leaders have warned that if the strikes dont end quickly coal shortages will shut down much of the countrys industry
on wednesday the kuznetsk strike committee and members of a highlevel government commission signed an agreement meeting many demands
the workers were promised higher wages increased deliveries of meat sugar soap clothes furniture and other consumer goods more housing construction and  most important  a greater voice in running their industry
its a victory over the system that weve had in the soviet union for the last  years a system in which we work hard but get little in return said pyotr a menayev an engineer at the taldinski severny open pit mine on the outskirts of prokopyevsk
strike committee member vyacheslav g akulov stressed that the miners had agreed to interrupt the strike not to end it
he said the miners would hold the government to its word if the government doesnt keep its promises we will go back on strike
the member strike committee met today with a halfdozen representatives to the national parliament and called for municipal elections to be advanced from the spring to the first half of november
the last local elections in kuznetsk were held two years ago before gorbachevs reforms made elections more democratic by offering multiple candidates
the strike wave began  days ago in kuznetsk the countrys secondlargest coal field
tass said late thursday that strikes had ended at six mines in the donetsk region but that most mines in the area remained on strike
miners at three shafts in chervonograd near the polish border joined the walkout thursday night said anatoly m dotsenko a spokesman for the ukrainian helsinki watch group
the coal industry employs more than  million workers
tass today quoted coal minister mikhail i shchadov as saying the government agreed to make all soviet coal operations economically and legally independent
he said authorities had agreed to additional payments for night and evening shifts and to give workers sundays off
beginning aug  mines and other industries in the coal mining complex will gain the right to sell for negotiated prices in the ussr and abroad products which they make over and above the state plan tass quoted the agreement as stipulating
it said local managers will be able to raise coal prices to reflect actual production costs
gorbachev is trying to end the longtime soviet practice of setting prices for goods that bear no relation to their freemarket value and encourage and end to central control of the economy
akulov said that beginning jan  the kuznetzk coal basin will become economically autonomous
the coal mining ministry will continue to run the mines but the miners will have a much greater say setting production levels and allocating the profits he said
our politics have gotten freer under perestroika akulov said of gorbachevs economic reform program
but our living conditions have not improved
until gorbachev rose to power in  strikes were not tolerated
ousted east german leader erich honecker was arrested and taken to prison today and a prosecutor said he will tried for high treason in march
honecker  was detained after his release from east berlins charite hospital where he had undergone surgery for a malignant kidney tumor the official adn news agency said
chief prosecutor hansjuergen joseph told parliament that honecker and former politburo members erich mielke guenter mittag and joachim herrmann would be tried by the supreme court on treason charges in march
all four have been expelled from the party
mielke was honeckers security chief mittag oversaw the economy and herrmann headed the partys propaganda department
eleven members of honeckers ousted politburo already are in prison awaiting trial
honeckers lawyer wolfgang vogel asked the chief prosecutor to free the former leader from rummelburg prison based on a doctors statement that he is too ill to stay in jail adn said
vogel is east germanys most prominent lawyer
one of honeckers doctors horst vogler said the former leader was very depressed and his mental state impaired following two major surgical operations since august
west german television showed an impassive honecker being led out of the hospital by his wife margot in predawn darkness
she kissed him goodbye before he was taken away in a large limousine
honeckers daughter soninlaw and youngest grandchild also came to see him off at the hospital adn quoted vogler as saying
the charge of high treason carries a maximum life imprisonment
the conviction used to carry the death penalty but that was abolished in reforms that followed honeckers ouster oct 
east germany has been caught up in a virtual frenzy to root out corruption and abuse of office
honecker the aging hardline stalinist leader who ruled east germany for  years had previously been declared too ill to withstand imprisonment
adn said the director of charite urology clinic dr peter althaus repeated today that in his opinion honecker is still not well enough to be jailed
on sunday west germanys masscirculation bild newspaper said honecker would be arrested but that he would be held at a prison hospital because of his condition
adn did not say whether rummelsburg prison is equipped with a medical facility
earlier this month east germanys luthern church had offered to put honecker up in a home for the aged upon his release from the hospital

a ranking member of chancellor helmut kohls party demanded the soviet union hand over erich honecker who is wanted by german authorities on manslaughter charges a newspaper reported on saturday
federal lawmaker johannes gerster said refusal to turn over the deposed east german leader for trial could burden bonn and moscows outstanding relations the neue osnabruecker zeitung newspaper reported
a berlin court has issued an arrest warrant for honecker  on the manslaughter charges
he is accused of issuing shoottokill orders to east german guards at the nowfallen berlin wall
honecker has denied all charges against him including that he was personally responsible for the estimated  people who died trying to escape his repressive government
he has taken refuge at a soviet military hospital in beelitz outside berlin
soviet officials have said honecker is staying at the hospital for humanitarian reasons and german police need permission from the soviets to gain entry
i demand that the soviet government immediately release erich honecker and extradite him to german justice officials the osnabrueck newspaper quoted gerster a member of kohls christian democrats as saying
honeckers fate is one of the first issues facing bonn and moscow since they signed several treaties designed to draw the two nations closer together
things are different he says he only wished the black community could have shared in some of the considerable profits generated by one of americas greatest sports events
 the super bowl is about money carley said last week
and last time we were basically onlookers
 things are a lot different this time around
this year carley is the cochairman of one of the featured events of super bowl week the bambaleo parade a saturday extravaganza with marching bands a street festival and floats
 the grand marshal of the parade will be lee roy selmon a former tampa bay buccaneer
 other events will include a salute to black sports legends and a doug williams golf tournament
 much more involvement this year the super bowl task force a group headed by two of the citys most influential white businessmen named two black men to head a communityrelations committee
 but perhaps most important carley said several minorityowned businesses have won lucrative contracts from the nfl for the game
 theres much more involvement this time black and white said carley who is the affirmativeaction officer for hillsboro community college
 theres been a heightened awareness
in  there was not even a thought given to a black man
 about  visitors many of them corporate and political movers and shakers were expected to arrive in tampa this week for the festivities leading up to the game sunday
 the game itself which is televised to  million people around the world is only part of an event whose impact on a city has been compared to that of a national political convention
 hotels restaurants and other businesses are anticipating an estimated  million in revenues with a total economic impact of  million
 its a bay window the super bowl introduces you to the world in a big way said barbara casey the coordinator of the super bowl task force
you dont have to say tampa fla anymore
 the super bowl also can highlight a communitys problems and bring the frustrations of many of its members to the surface
 its more than a window into a town said jim steeg director of special events for the nfl
its a bay window
 last month nfl commissioner paul tagliabue said he would stand by his recommendation to move the  super bowl out of tempe ariz because the state does not have a holiday honoring dr martin luther king
 a week before the super bowl in miami two years ago the fatal shooting of a black man on a motorcycle by an hispanic police officer in the predominantly black overtown neighborhood set off three days of looting and torchings of buildings and cars
 while the disturbances were not caused by the super bowl the nfl was criticized at the time for not making enough of an effort to include minoritygroup members in the festivities
 i think miami was the awakening for a lot of people carley said
 in tampa super bowl xxv brought about the cancellation of what was the biggest annual event in the city for  years the gasparilla parade an extravaganza that featured  of the citys most powerful men swaggering through the streets dressed as guntoting pirates
 tampa officials made the parade part of their pitch to the nfl for the super bowl
but after tampa was awarded the  super bowl a racial dispute erupted over the parade which always has been sponsored and organized by an allwhite allmale private club ye mystic krewe of gasparilla
 the clubs top officials refused the demands of a coalition of black residents including carley that the club be integrated immediately
instead they canceled the parade
 the super bowl task force had to scramble to put together a new parade and carley became the cochairman of that effort
 super bowl xxvi super bowl xxvi will be played jan   in the metrodome
it will be minneapolis first time as the host city
the last time the super bowl was held in a coldclimate city was in  when the ers beat the cincinnati bengals  in pontiac mich
west german chancellor helmut kohl declared on his return from moscow on sunday that the way is now free for german reunification
his meeting with soviet president mikhail s gorbachev convinced him he told west german radio that the two german states should enter into negotiations as quickly as possible after the march  east german election
kohl will meet with east german prime minister hans modrow on tuesday and wednesday in bonn to discuss immediate steps in economic cooperation including monetary union to prevent the collapse of the faltering east german economy
political and economic union go hand in hand kohl said
he said that immediate steps must be taken on the economic front to stop the hemorrhage of east germans to the federal republic and keep them in their heimat or home in east germany
kohl said that his talks with gorbachev  who told him that reunification is a matter for the germans themselves to decide  could lead to an economic breakthrough in east germany which in turn could provide a push forward for all of europe
asked how soon the two germanys could merge kohl declared that the march election has to come first and then i think it will all go very quickly
the chancellor said that almost all of the political parties and opposition groups in east germany now support reunification
and after the election he said they will want to put their programs into practice quickly
gorbachev inquired about plans by west german politicians to campaign in east germany kohl said adding that the soviet leader did not appear to be upset about such political activity
west germanys social democratic party is expected to campaign heavily in east germany in support of a fledging branch of the party that has taken a surprisingly strong lead in public opinion polls
major members of the party including former chancellor willy brandt are scheduled to appear at rallies on behalf of the east german social democrats
with the surge of the east german social democrats political analysts are pointing to the strange role they could play in the ultimate political fate of kohl
ever since reunification became a blazing issue kohls standing in west german opinion polls has risen and if the national elections now scheduled for december were held today he would have a good chance of leading his christian democratic union to victory
but if the two germanys are fused before the west germany election in december the growing number of social democratic voters in what today is east germany  who would presumably be allowed to vote in december  could easily tip the balance away from the christian democrats pushing kohl out of the government leadership
for almost a decade margaret thatcher was regarded at the white house as americas best friend the trusted ally whose strong views reinforced the conservative tone of administration policies
among western allies she was alone at ronald reagans side in  in supporting the us bombing of libya
in the persian gulf crisis she boldly joined with george bush in sending troops to the middle east
you always know where she was and what she believed bush said upon hearing of her decision to resign
she has always been an outstanding ally of the united states he said
i will miss her
there were many doubters around the world when reagan arrived in washington with an economic program of freemarket capitalism that seemed out of step with the times
mrs thatcher wasnt one of the skeptics she was advocating a similar program at home
they shared rocky relations with organized labor
reagan successfully fired the nations air traffic controllers dealing a devastating blow to labor
she too smashed restive unions
on foreign policy she frequently was more right wing than reagan  certainly more so than bush
reagan never made any secret of his special affection for the british prime minister
they were ideological soulmates and called each other ronnie and margaret
at international gatherings they usually were side by side
two years ago as they met for the final time before reagan left office the president said he was leaving the white house with considerable satisfaction in the knowledge that margaret thatcher will still reside at no
 downing street
she later wrote him a dear ron letter in which she praised him as a great president one of the greatest
like reagan she was deeply suspicious of the soviet union
together they advocated a hard line toward moscow and championed military readiness  even though she was the first to recognize mikhail s gorbachev as a leader she could do business with
mrs thatcher encouraged the huge pentagon buildup that reagan nurtured under the theme of peace through strength
she was a big backer of us efforts to install mediumrange missiles in europe and always seemed cautious  perhaps reluctant  when it came to disarmament
when argentina and britain clashed militarily over the falkland islands the united states was forced to make a painful choice between two allies
ronnie sided with margaret
washingtons special relationship with london seemed to slip when reagan left power
bush and mrs thatcher disagreed publicly last year over her governments decision to deport vietnamese and cambodian boat people who were fleeing their countries to hong kong
bush a veteran of world politics knew many leaders around the globe
mrs thatcher suddenly seemed to be just one of the gang
the berlin wall was collapsing and it appeared as if bush found german chancellor helmut kohl more interesting than mrs thatcher
she was merely one in a parade of foreign dignitaries who got the prized invitation to visit bush at camp david this year
nevertheless bush said he expected the special relationship between the united states and great britain to remain on a steady keel
mrs thatcher did her part demonstrating her loyalty
for awhile she and bush were seemingly alone in their suspicions of gorbachevs unilateral cutbacks in troops and arms in europe and appeared uncertain how to respond
under intense pressure from congress bush began to warm to the soviet leader
now they seem almost best of friends
on the persian gulf bush said he would not rule out possible military force and ordered a huge buildup of troops to make his threat credible
mrs thatcher characteristically was tougher
she said that unless saddam hussein got out of kuwait soon the west would have to use military force to dislodge him
she called saddam a loser and the statecontrolled iraqi news agency replied that she was an old hag
now she is leaving
no one suspects that britains new leadership  whoever it is  will take a soft line toward iraq
yet if the going gets tough it might have been comforting for bush to be able to hear the tough old line from thatcher
communism suffered its first big mac attack thursday as mcdonalds opened a restaurant in yugoslavia and police were called in to keep customers who lined up for hours from getting too unruly under the golden arches
i just wanted to taste genuine american hamburgers said milica nikolic a high school student who waited for three hours to taste her first big mac
people curiously examined the renovated restaurants plush interior and the backlit signs depicting the hamburgers french fries milk shakes and other fare more familiar in the west
it also featured ambercolored tables and floors pastelcolored upholstery modern art paintings and discreet illumination
the fastfood outlet located on a downtown square had drawn crowds in recent days and they began gathering long before it opened thursday
police kept watch on the lines of customers snaking around the block and they regulated the number who came inside to avoid overcrowding
no opening of a restaurant in belgrade has created such a sensation as this one today one policeman said
i think this restaurant has no competition in belgrade said milica danic a housewife who treated her son to a cheeseburger
it is much cleaner the service is faster the interior is nicer and it is not too expensive
the belgrade media have suggested that the success of mcdonalds in yugoslavia depends on its acceptance by citizens long accustomed to a hamburgerlike fastfood dish called the pljeskavica ground pork and onions on a bun
in fact this is a clash between the big mac and pljeskavica said vesna milosevic an official of genex a yugoslav staterun enterprise that has contracted a joint venture agreement with mcdonalds
our aim is not to destroy the pljeskavica on the yugoslav market said predrag dostanic managing director of the genexmcdonalds
we want to change customs of the local people used to completly different eating habits
he said that lounging at tables for a long time after a finished meal will draw a warning
also smoking is forbidden and alcohol will not be served
this contrasts sharply with the balkan and yugoslav custom of sitting with a drink in smokefilled restaurants and chatting with friends after the meal
the big mac meal consisting of a hamburger soft drink and french fries costs the equivalent of  or about as much the similar meal would cost in numerous pljeskavica joints around town
sadik seljami a waiter in a small pljeskavica outlet just a few hundred yards from the mcdonalds suggested that the american restaurant wants to drive yugoslav fastfood outlets out of business
however we will not give up the fight even if we have to lower the prices said seljami
glen cook an executive of the mcdonalds corp said during the opening ceremonies we are very excited about the opening of this restaurant not only because it is the first one in a communist country but also because it is one of the nicest in europe
mcdonalds and genex contribute  million each for the flagship restaurant
they will also share the profits equally even though it will be managed entirely by yugoslavs
the restaurant has  seats and employs  people capable of serving  meals per hour
in an effort to keep a high level of services the management is entitled to fire any employees who fail to perform
the american corporation plans to open five additional restaurants yugoslavia in the next five years
the next east european mcdonalds and the first in a soviet bloc country is to open next month in budapest hungary
hundreds of people gathered to honor the  sailors who died on the uss iowa as victims of a tragedy that reaches into little towns all over the country

 gun turret
lt cmdr
james cudler a pentagon spokesman said the explosion occurred as an iowa officer was making a videotape to record the firing of the ships big guns

crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked out all the oxygen according to a report in todays editions of the washington post
maj tom johnston a spokesman for the atlantic fleet in norfolk said he had no information on the causes of death
the explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun the newspaper said
after the fire was extinguished crewmen worked quickly to remove the shells and powder from the other two guns the newspaper said
nbc news reported friday that the exact cause of the explosion may never be known because the devastation inside the turret was so complete
the top members of the senate armed services committee said the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion
the pentagon has ordered the inch guns on all four world war iiera battleships silenced until the investigation is finished
some critics have said the inch guns are outmoded and dangerous
jim smith  of norfolk said he attended the memorial because he considered the dead men his shipmates
i served aboard the battleship north carolina in 
i know about those big guns 
i know these things can happen he said
at times like this everyone seems to pull together
we become one family
joan taplett wife of a navy commander said she brought her yearold son so he would always remember the men who died
im from south dakota
when i heard that one of the men killed was from there i had to come she said
i guess im here for his parents
something like this touches all of us 
it reaches into little towns all over the country she said
david l hanson a yearold electricians mate rd class from bison sd population  was among those killed
a wreath of  yellow carnations was cast into the river a norfolk police honor guard gave a gun salute and a navy bugler played taps at the minute ceremony
on the uss iowa  young men died too soon  we will remember and honor and grieve as a nation gov
gerald l baliles said
the navy is planning a ceremony for the crew and family members monday morning at norfolk naval base with president bush scheduled to attend
prime minister margaret thatcher said monday the irish republican army members who blew up the royal marines school of music and killed  bandsmen last week are monsters who will be found and punished
the young men whom we lost were murdered by common murderers who must be found and brought to justice and put behind bars for a very long time she said following a tour of the schools wrecked barracks in deal southeast england
we lost  remarkable musicians not fighting men just because some people try to bomb others out of their democratic views she said
they are very evil people absolute monsters
gerry adams president of sinn fein the legal political arm of the ira issued a statement disputing mrs thatchers remarks saying she knows in her heart of hearts the real nature of the conflict its cause and the remedy
the ira is fighting to end british rule in northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province with the roman catholic republic of ireland
we want an end to all violent deaths arising out of the present relationship between our two countries adams said
we want a new peaceful relationship based on an acceptance and respect for our rights as a sovereign nation
after visiting some of the  injured bandsmen still in the hospital mrs thatcher pledged the hunt for the bombers will be pursued with all possible speed vigor and dedication
raymond kendall the secretarygeneral of the international police organization interpol pledged the organizations full support in the hunt for those who blew up the school
i hope we will have a part to play in finding them said kendall after opening the international police exhibition and conference in london
they are criminals of the worst sort and should be dealt with as such
before landing in deal mrs thatchers helicopter flew over the rubble that had been the bands recreation center
the ira claimed responsibility for the explosion and police said they are looking for three men with irish accents who rented a house overlooking the barracks
sports illustrated is taking  advertisers to super bowl xxi in pasadena calif this weekend for an allout bash
along with getting seats for sundays game the guests will brunch at the chic spago restaurant take a private tour of universal studios and attend a wingding at the century plaza hotel
the magazine is just one of hundreds of businesses whose officials and customers will be among the  fans attending the super bowl
and the companies show few signs of cutting back on their activities despite the new tax laws tighter restrictions on what can be claimed as a businessentertainment expense
still the new rules do change things for a variety of super bowl entertaining  from an executive sitting in a  seat on the yard line to a businessman holding a super bowl party in his living room and hoping to write off the costs
one big change under the new law limits businessentertainment deductions for tickets to sporting events like the super bowl only  of the face value of such tickets can be deducted
if a company purchases a a yardline seat for   the going rate  it can deduct only  of the tickets  face value or 
even to get the  deduction there still must be a substantial and bona fide business discussion before during or after the game says julian block a tax specialist at prenticehall information services inc to take a client to a game as merely a goodwill gesture is no longer enough mr block says
and if a company wants to simply give clients tickets to the game the business gift carries a total deduction of only  for each recipient
the tougher irs rule however hasnt slowed ticket demand even endzone seats are fetching  each
even if it werent tax deductible itd be worth it says tom foley chairman of bibb co a macon ga maker of home furnishings and textile products that use the national football league team logos
bibb is flying about  people  mostly customers  to the game
we get more earnings from the trip than the expense says mr foley
some companies say they are making adjustments or at least educating their executives about the new rules
a spokesman for adolph coors  co the golden colo brewery said its tax advisers instructed executives that this cant be just a fun trip  we have to discuss business
air fare and lodging are still  deductible as long as there is a planned business meeting in addition to the game
meals are now  deductible as long as business is discussed
under the old law meals were fully deductible and all a company had to do was show a business relationship with the guest
companies can get a  deduction for a presuper bowl banquet since the new tax law has a banquet meeting exception
such meetings must have at least  persons half of whom are away from home and there must be a speaker
executives who bring clients over to the house to watch the super bowl on television also face new restrictions on deductions for food and liquor says william j lipton tax partner of the accounting firm ernst  whinney
if a host wants to deduct  of the bill he or she must talk business with all of the guests mr lipton says
one safety measure make a businessoriented speech mr block suggests
he also advises party hosts to keep a guest list and note their business connection
that will be a big job for barron hilton chairman of hilton hotels corp who along with alex spanos owner of the san diego chargers is holding a presuper bowl brunch sunday at the beverly hilton hotel for  guests including business leaders entertainment personalities and customers
allen hermansen a hilton senior vice president says the bash is tax deductible because our sales people will be there and business will be discussed
he admits however were not going to twist any arms
were there to say thankyou to those whove given us business
an irs spokesman says more agents will be assigned to corporate audits of businessentertainment expenses this year
but irs enforcement of the rules could be as difficult as blocking the new york giants lawrence taylor
as a practical matter as long as people say they talked business at a super bowl party how can the irs dispute it
says vickie king a price waterhouse tax official
the only people who will get into trouble are those who dont keep receipts
the revelation that john major is capable of candid blunt and salty language when talking offthe record to friendly journalists has surprised some people
it has even been suggested that the recording of the prime ministers conversation with michael brunson itns political editor in which major used a variety of four six and eightletter words to communicate his lack of fondness for certain colleagues may do him good
with luck it is reckoned majors image as a leadentongued wimp may undergo correction
what piffle
major is a gonner especially after this weeks revolt of the woodentops in the christchurch byelection where a conservative majority of  at last years general election was converted into a  majority for the liberal democrats
fifteen months too late the voters of christchurch rounded on the tories with a malignant and squeaky fury
in reality all politicians not just major are far more candid and salty when chatting in private than when speaking in public
in public they have to be careful of what they say so their utterances achieve a horrible mattness
but in private they relax
their syntax disappears
their words become nonsensical
they swear and joke and shout
it really is a spectacle
to show you what i mean i spoke yesterday to john major and john smith
smith a scot is leader of the labour party though not many people know that
in the aftermath of christchurch where labour lost its deposit i wanted to provoke the two johns into a spot of real soulsearching
to guarantee them privacy i used a signalscrambler
no one could have eavesdropped
their responses were true to form
but i have left out the swearwords because the new financial times style guide states that the gratuitous use of expletives or obscenities is discouraged 
fourletter expletives will usually be confined to infrequent use in the review arts pages
i can live with that though why the artsyfartsies should receive any dispensation is a puzzle
first i tackled major
i said did you read john what olivier blanchard rudiger dornbusch stanley fischer franco modigliani paul a samuelson and robert solow wrote in just one article in the ft this week
they were describing europes lunatic monetary policies and exchange rate arrangements
they did not pull their punches
i bet you went chalkwhite
so why not walk the plank john
you are the most unpopular prime minister since the start of the fourth century
why invite more punishment
unfairly or not you are drawing the blame for all lifes unpleasantnesses let alone the cockups
are you sure
the prime minister replied
i mean 
how did it come about michael 
like christchurch yknow  load of 
let me put it to you  the economy of course 
i mean wimpy guy like me
but im not giving in like that like 
on and on it went
then i rang john smith
i told him i had been impressed with his interview with andrew marr in the independent on thursday in which he sharpened up his promise to introduce meaty political reforms if he ever gets elected including a referendum on proportional representation
i said you are starting to raise your game john
many people will have agreed with your assertion that democracy in britain is decaying and that the tories must be roasted for their arrogance incompetence complacency and sharp practices  especially their centralisation of power and the elimination of opposition
but some of your critics still accuse you john of laziness and ineffectualness
what do you say to that
away ye thowless jad shouted the labour leader
gie me owit an sense a life behint a kist to lie an sklent
our stibblerig was rab mgraen a clever sturdy fellow but then he was sae fleyd by his showther gae a keek an tumbld wi a wintle
likewise with political and constitutional reform michael for by the l   d tho i should beg wilyart pow ill laugh an sing an shake my leg as langs i dow after that i thought of telephoning wingcommander paddy ashdown leader of the liberal democrats to solicit his views on christchurch
but i couldnt raise the energy
president mikhail s gorbachev said today that thousands of striking coal miners and other workers are urging railway employees to join the work stoppage and that the unrest threatens his economic reforms
strikes have shut down more than  mines and factories in the countrys two top coalproducing regions official reports said
in a report to the supreme soviet gorbachev said they have resulted in a  millionton drop in coal production
following gorbachev to the podium legislator anatoly saunin said each lost work day cost millions of rubles that might otherwise help improve living conditions
you mustnt hold a knife to the throat of the government he told strikers
saunin from the donetsk region of the ukraine the countrys top coal region said the number of striking mines there increased from  on tuesday to  today
now there are reports of calls to railroad workers to join the strike as of aug  gorbachev said during the parliamentary session which was broadcast on television and radio
such a development of events poses a threat to the implementation of plans projected by the policy of perestroika he said referring to his efforts to restructure the economy
miners began walking out july  in siberias kuznetsk basin coal region
workers in other industries in the region soon followed
on saturday miners in the donetsk coal basin began walking off the job
the miners are demanding more local control over their industry as well as higher wages and better living conditions
gorbachev said he and premier nikolai i ryzhkov sent a telegram to miners in the ukraine assuring them that any concessions granted to siberian miners would apply to other mining regions as well
he blamed some of the miners discontent on antisocialist elements but said he understood their basic demands
government negotiations with strike committees have resolved most of the miners demands including those on pensions and overtime but some longerterm questions will take up to a month to settle and the miners are refusing any delay he said
central authorities have so far balked at granting miners more control over their industry
if the strike spreads to other sectors of the economy we may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what weve been doing gorbachev said without specifying what steps he would take
he said the lost coal production could not be recovered by increasing the mines output because they already work at full capacity
recent reports have put the total number of strikers in the donetsk and kuznetsk regions at more than  but the number appeared to be rising
because of disrupted coal deliveries the strike threatened a catastrophe at metallurgical and electrical power plants tass said
the politburo sent to kuznetsk nikolai n slyunkov a member of the ruling communist party body who worked several years in the tractorbuilding industry and has spoken about labor discipline
he held marathon meetings with strikers monday night and tuesday and addressed  people in the main square of prokopyevsk  miles east of moscow
miners in the donetsk basin are demanding a  percent wage increase for night work improved living conditions a fixed day off and retirement after  years of underground work
they also demand that the coal mining ministry trim its managerial staff
tass carried a report tuesday denying that the soviet unions third major coal region karaganda in kazakhstan also was on strike
a proposed law on ending strikes and other labor conflicts is being rushed through the supreme soviet legislature tass said
a spokesman for the strike committee in prokopyevsk valery legachev said tuesday that slyunkov promised to increase the areas regular food supplies by  to  percent as well as soap and washing powder
izvestia the government newspaper reported tuesday that slyunkov promised higher pay for night work longer vacations and a doubling of the wholesale price of coal to pay for the benefits
the strikes are believed to be the nations worst since the s when the country was gripped in revolution civil war and a power struggle
records from that period are sketchy but fighting was widespread and industrial production was severely disrupted
until gorbachev came to power in  the official media did not report job actions in the soviet union
underground reports described strikes that were of much shorter and not as widespread as those in kuznetsk and donetsk
moslem extremists abducted a leading businessman and an educator friday and threatened to kill them a day after authorities killed six militants crossing into pakistan for arms and training police said
roads were blocked around srinagar where the hostages were seized and soldiers tightened security around the kashmir valley where the government launched a crackdown jan  on the moslem separatist movement
a telephone caller told a local reporter the abductors were also holding a third hostage and all three men would be killed within  hours of a monday afternoon deadline for releasing three jailed militants
the caller claimed to speak for the students liberation front a branch of the jammukashmir liberation front fighting for autonomy in the predominantly moslem state
india itself is overwhelmingly hindu
police sources who demanded anonymity and the telephone caller both identified the new kidnap victims as vice chancellor mushir ulhaq of kashmir university and lm
khela general manager of hindustan machine tools co
the caller said ulhaqs private secretary also was being held hostage but that could not be confirmed
moslem separatists had warned indian government officials to leave jammukashmir state before april or face the consequences
police said the border violence took place in kupwara district where at least  separatists tried to sneak into neighboring pakistan to receive military training and buy weapons
no details were available
india says pakistan trains and arms the militants in kashmir at the far northern tip of india
pakistan denies it
india and pakistan have fought two wars over the region since  when both nations won independence from britain
on the spot where lenin once spoke the focus tuesday was on lennon
official newspapers which once denounced the beatles as harmful pests from the decadent west joined a worldwide celebration and ran stories of tribute about the late john lennon who would have turned  on tuesday
state radio broadcast his music and interviews about him
two concerts devoted to the songwriter guitarist and singer who was shot to death in  were held in moscow
even the staid state television program vremya got into act
an anchorman more accustomed to reading official government news reported on the worldwide lennon birthday bash and called his song imagine an anthem of peace
the broadcast ended with an instrumental version of yesterday playing as temperatures from around the nation rolled across the screen
the celebration was a dramatic turnabout from soviet authorities repression of beatles fans and supression of their music in earlier times
their music was banned and the soviet press condemned them
a  article for instance commented these bugs can swiftly ignite the very darkest and primitive passions
about  soviets mostly second generation beatles fans flocked to the moscow electrical lamp factorys cultural hall in northeastern part of the city to rejoice in lennons music
a plaque outside the hall reminded beatles fans that lennons near namesake vladimir lenin the founder of the soviet state had spoken at the spot in  and 
inside fans listened to recordings of lennons music attended a concert of about a dozen soviet rock bands bought his albums and posters and reflected on his life
hes like a hero a symbol for every person a symbol of honesty talent devotion to his ideals notion of love equality between people and goodness said irina dykomkina the yearold secretary of the sgt
peppers club a soviet beatles fan club formed two years ago
lennons music she said crosses borders easily
his music is so sincere its so understandable even to people who dont know english
they feel the music
andrei trushkin a correspondent for komsomolskaya pravda  the communist party youth newspaper that devoted a full page tuesday to lennon  said he appeals to soviet youth in part because he was a rebel like many of them and was a difficult teenager
the cops would have locked him up many times said trushkin who helped organize the concert
tuesdays concert opened in the spirit of a birthday party
balloons floated down from the balconies as a tape of lennons song starting over played
the stage was adorned with a painting of lennon and lifesize cardboard cutouts of the fab four in front of the british flag
oorah
oorah
shouted the audience which included a few soldiers in uniform
onstage the groups sprint quiet hour and optimal variant played in beatles style but were joined by a group that didnt quite fit in the genre an americanstyle country ensemble that wore plaid vests and performed night train to memphis
spencer tracys acting technique was simply less is better and that helped make him the screens greatest actor
the tracy credo is recommended to future producers of academy award shows
wednesday nights orgy of selfcongratulation was dazzling glamorous and all those familiar hollywood adjectives
also too much
too many endless production numbers
too much forced conversation between couples
too many awards with meaning lost to the general public
the use of couples costars compadres and companions as presenters for the st academy awards at the shrine auditorium was clever but wearing
the best oscar shows have been emceed by will rogers bob hope johnny carson and other funnymen who provided continuity as well as a leavening of pomposity
the brightest moments of the st awards came from billy crystal robin williams and bob hope but they were all too brief
tom selleck remarked that douglas fairbanks sr handed out the first awards in  in five minutes
the present awards could be staged in two hours instead of the  hours and  minutes they took wednesday night on abctv
but the show will never be shorter
reason the time is needed to sell all those second adds at  per

editors wednesdays ceremony was bob thomas th academy awards
tomorrow evening just before the olympic closing ceremony the last and one of the most prestigious events of the games will be held
it is also without doubt the most gruelling
run in high heat high humidity high pollution levels and over an extraordinary course the barcelona olympic mens marathon will prove one of the most physically demanding ever run
there are lots of figures to show why
it is estimated that when the race begins in mataro a seaside town north of barcelona the temperature will be an alreadyuncomfortable c
towards the marathons end however radiant heat thrown off by buildings could be subjecting the runners to a temperature of up to c
more debilitating still relative humidity in barcelona in august rises as high as  per cent
with more than  kilometres still to go most of the course is an upward run
the last km which take the runners m higher still to the olympic stadium at the top of the hill of montjuic has an average gradient of more than  per cent and includes some sections of  per cent equivalent in skiing terms to a steep red run
but we do not need figures to convince us of the extraordinary difficulty of tomorrows race
last saturday in the olympic stadium i watched the final moments and aftermath of the womens marathon begun at the same time of day and run in similar conditions
never in any event voluntarily entered into sporting or otherwise have i seen such signs of physical and mental distress
the race was won by the unified teams valentina yegorova in  hours  minutes a time considerably slower than that achieved by women on less demanding olympic marathon courses in los angeles and seoul
after her nearest competitor japans yuko arimori came in eight seconds later they had the energy  between bouts of grimacing and lowering their heads to their knees  to embrace each other and smile for the cameras
it was a different story in the mixed zone the area under the stadium where athletes recover after their events
as runner after runner stumbled and limped into the room  several were brought in senseless on stretchers  the scene seemed to be populated by exhausted boat people rescued after weeks of exposure and deprivation at sea
as a photographer calmly shot off a roll of film a foot from her face manuela machado of mexico and another runner stood vomiting violently into a potted palm
several competitors lay prone and gasping on the ground as water was poured over them others stood hunched over grasping their abdomens
if anyone moved at all it was with agonised faces and the slowest of hobbles
these are not the sort of scenes likely to promote enthusiasm for marathon running or for the ideals of olympic competition
chris brasher organiser of the london marathon was on hand to witness the suffering and was incensed
male marathon runners will face the same kind of problems with heat humidity and an overdemanding terrain he said
in his opinion gearing the marathon to primetime tv viewing and having the event end at the top of a hill for the sake of stadium spectators was unjustified and a sellout to commercialism
to put on the marathon in the late afternoon rather than first thing in the morning the normal practice and then to make them run km up a hill is just criminal in my opinion said brasher a former olympic gold medal athlete and noted sportswriter
i spoke to britains steve brace winner of the paris marathon in  and  the berlin marathon last year and a competitor in the barcelona event
he agrees that the run will be highly demanding and while he regards olympic marathon running as a pinnacle of his career he is cautious about tomorrows slog
like almost all the athletes running tomorrow brace is a professional runner who specialises in marathons
he takes an objective longterm view of his profession
as an incomeearner marathon running is an activity with liabilities and limitations and requires business management as well as physical ability
the winner of the london marathon earns a tidy dollars  and the new york boston and japanese runs are all in the same prizewinning category
but these and less financiallyrewarding events are physically debilitating and can only be won if a competitor is in top physical shape
with their careers and financial prospects in mind toplevel runners normally only run two marathons a year
as brace says when you have only two paydays out of  you choose plan and train for them with great care
brace trains extremely carefully indeed
running a marathon is the easy part he says
the hard part is the leadup to achieving the performance level required
he starts training three months before an event by running  miles a week and then building progressively
for the last six weeks he runs  miles a week
normally he would hope that such a routine brings a payoff
but the olympic marathon is an exception the only toplevel marathon that carries no prize money
brace says that in spite of the prestige and possible financial spinoffs involved it does not necessarily make sense to run to win
given the highly demanding nature of the course and their desire to preserve physical condition for races that do bring in money he says many runners will give less than their best effort
nonetheless there are plenty whose considerations stretch beyond the purely financial
italian gelindo bordin who came first in the  seoul olympic marathon is a strong contender
so is djiboutis ahmed salah who came third in seoul
ibrahim hussein of kenya and hiromi taniguchi of japan are also possible winners
none of them though will make a molehill out of the steep and formidable ascent of montjuic
andrei d sakharov urged members of the academy of sciences on monday to reject the leaderships list of candidates for the new soviet legislature which does not include the nobel peace prize winner
the yearold nuclear physicist and human rights activist who won the nobel in  said in a speech to the academy that many scientists objected to the slate for sundays election approved by the leadership in january
sakharov and several other wellknown proponents of reform are missing from the list
the official news agency tass quoted him as saying however that scientists were upset not because sakharov was not nominated but because the role of scientific institutions was ignored
he called for reversal of what he called the antidemocratic decision which produced a list of what critics describe as oldguard managers of scientific institutions
a vote on the academy candidates is scheduled for tuesday
sakharov was nominated from several geographic districts for a seat in the new member congress of peoples deputies but he decided to refuse the nominations and fight for an academy of sciences seat
under an election law approved in december  seats in the legislature are reserved for the communist party and its affiliates and for professional social and trade union organizations
the other  will be filled by representatives of the  soviet republics and their electoral districts
those in the academy who support sakharov hope to force a new round of nominations by mustering enough support to deny all nominees a majority said andrei mironov a former political prisoner
that would force the academy to start over and produce a new list of nominees under terms of the new election law
twentyfive seats were allotted to the academy but it gave five to affiliated societies and associations
from  nominees the academy leadership chose  candidates for the remaining  seats
although  research institutes nominated sakharov he was not chosen for the final slate
the leaderships decision inspired widespread press criticism and a demonstration at the academys moscow headquarters
tass said  academicians corresponding members and representatives of reseach institutes attended the threeday meeting that began monday
the first three days of this week may become the hottest spring days for soviet scientists it said alluding to the leaderships rejection of such reformers as sakharov space scientist roald sagdeev and sociologist tatyana zaslavsakaya
the agency acknowledged many scientists were unsatisfied with the slate of candidates
mironov said two other academicians also spoke on monday in favor of new nominations
no details of their remarks were available
the largest family group to visit black leader nelson mandela since he was jailed  years ago gathered in cape town for a meeting tuesday with the prisoner on his st birthday
his wife winnie mandela arrived monday night and indicated she did not expect mandela leader of the african national congress would be freed soon
she said that opinion came from her husband who she visited last week after mandelas july  meeting with president pw
botha
that meeting sparked speculation that mandela would be freed this year
he is serving a life term after being convicted of sabotage and plotting to overthrow the whitedominated government
mrs mandela referring to her earlier visit with her husband told reporters he said from that meeting with pw
botha we musnt construe as indicating his release
his release wasnt even there
in fact it was not on the agenda at all
mrs mandela dressed in black as an expression of mourning spoke with reporters at the df
malan airport
she said the family normally spent mandelas birthday at home fasting and praying but members would visit him this year on his birthday because he has invited us to come and share it with him
the family said  relatives including children from both of mandelas marriages would go to mandelas house at the victor verster prison farm in paarl north of cape town
in addition to mrs mandela the group will include three of mandelas children one daughterinlaw eight grandhildren and a greatgrandson
mrs mandela showed reporters a huge cardboard birthday card in the black green and yellow colors of the outlawed african national congress the largest guerrilla group fighting the government
she said the card was made by members of the national union of mineworkers
it is very nice but it is also at the same time very sad she said of the planned birthday celebration
after all he is not at home
mandela was allowed to meet last friday with five other anc members convicted with him in  of trying to overthrow the government and still imprisoned in cape town according to dullah omar a family friend and attorney
mandela has been in prison since  when he was sentenced to five years for leaving the country illegally and organizing an illegal strike
he was given a life sentence following the  conviction
omar said tuesdays family gathering will be an occasion with a strong theme of sadness because after the reunion they will leave mr mandela to resume his lonely life
mandelas oldest grandson mandla  arrived monday evening from swaziland where he is a student at a private school
mandla is the son of makgatho mandela the prisoners eldest son by his first marriage to evelyn ntoko mase who lives in the black township of soweto and was not expected to join the reunion
makgatho mandela came to cape town with his wife zondi his daughter indaba and yearold thembela mandelas greatgrandson
thembela is the grandson of tembikile mandela
tembikile mandelas son by his marriage to evelyn ntoko mase died in an automobile accident in 
evelyn ntoko mase the cousin of anc leader walter sisulu who has been imprisoned with mandela married nelson mandela in 
they had four children
one of their daughters makaziwe mandelaamuah arrived with her three children from the united states where she is studying for a doctoral degree in anthropology at amherst college in massachusetts
she said he nelson mandela believes that education is the key to all doors and he would like to see all of his children get an education in fact all of the black children  because you cannot claim to want to rule the country and be the leaders of the future if you have people who are untrained and dont have any skills
mrs mandelaamuah said of her fathers possible release i always firmly believe that you cant predict what the south african government will do
moslem militants armed with automatic rifles shot and killed two unarmed paramilitary soldiers on thursday in srinagar the flashpoint of a violent separatist campaign officials said
witnesses said a cigarette vendor also was killed in the attack which occurred outside the vendors kiosk in the chanpora suburb of the city
a bystander was injured said the witnesses who spoke on condition of anonymity

bfn beijing june  xinhua  floods have all receded along xijiang beijiang xiangjiang and ganjiang except at a section of the xijiang river in wuzhou city guangxi a spokesman from the state flood control and drought relief headquarters announced today
the spokesman attributed the falling water level to the major water conservancy projects which help to mitigate losses
meanwhile he said tension has been eased in the pearl river delta as the latest tropical storm has been weakened after landing in yangjiang city guangdong province
floods hit guangdong guangxi hunan jiangxi fujiang and zhejiang provinces following the first heavy rains and floods which typically hit china from the south to the north from june to august
earlier reports said that successive torrential rainstorms in the xijiang and beijiang river valleys in early and midjune resulted in a big flood one of the most serious in  years in guangdong province and caused heavy losses
major flood monitoring stations on the two rivers recorded their highest water levels all four meters above the warning level
in an urgent conference late yesterday the guangdong provincial government urged localities to help flood victims with food shelter clothing and medical care so that no one would die of hunger and no epidemic disease would break out in the flooded areas
the province has allocated  million kg of grain and  million yuan in cash along with over  million tons of such farm production supplies as chemical fertilizer and diesel oil to the floodstricken areas

it was not only the latvian government alksnis accused of this but also the united states
according to him during the latest visit to the united states by latvian president guntis ulmanis sanction was obtained for the adoption of the aforementioned discriminatory law
begin alksnis recording and thus carte blanche was given for mild ethnic cleansing of the russian speaking population of the republic
end recording zaytseva apart from that alksnis added according to information received from reliable sources certain circles in moscow want conflict in latvia
begin alksnis recording a certain scenario exists to drive a socalled security corridor along the route daugavpilsyekabpilsriga where stringent ethnic cleansing of the latvian population will take place in reply to the mild ethnic cleansing of the russian population in order to bring socalled independent latvia to its knees
end recording zaytseva journalists asked for more precise information about what alksnis called reliable sources
begin alksnis recording you understand that i cannot name these sources
but i can say that they are fairly authoritative
end recording zaytseva asked what he intends to do alksnis said his opportunities are unfortunately limited and that is why he is appealing to journalists
in his opinion only joint efforts can bring this information to the attention of world public opinion point out the seriousness of this issue and avoid the coming tragedy

tuesdays earthquake the strongest on the san andreas fault since the san francisco quake on april   came in a place that had been identified by scientists just last year as the most likely spot for a major jolt in northern california within the next  years
the epicenter of the temblor eight miles eastnortheast of the city of santa cruz in the santa cruz mountains was at virtually the same spot as earthquakes in the magnitude range that occurred on june   and aug  
a magnitude quake was centered there in 
the us geological survey in a  report on regions of high earthquake probability in california said there was a  chance of another magnitude earthquake in the immediate vicinity by the year 
the report cited even higher probabilities for major temblors on the san andreas near parkfield in central california and coachella in southern california in the same period but it pinpointed the santa cruz mountains as the most vulnerable spot in northern california in part because the area marked the southernmost point of maximum ground slippage during the  earthquake
a period of  years is short as far as earthquake intervals go and during this time scientists said tuesday night pressure was probably building up in the southern neighboring segment of the san andreas which had not slipped as much
thomas heaton the geological survey scientist in charge of the agencys pasadena field office said that the  and  earthquakes now must be seen as preshocks of the tuesdays  temblor
he said foreshocks would not be the proper term since months had elapsed before the more powerful earthquake struck
heaton said that a still larger shock is unlikely
but he joined caltech scientists in saying that aftershocks as strong as  magnitude should be expected and that the pattern of aftershocks could last for months
a  aftershock would be as strong as the  whittier quake in the los angeles area
after both the  and the  earthquakes in the santa cruz mountains the state office of emergency services and the us geological survey issued warnings of increased risk of sizable shakes ranging up to  magnitude within the next few days in the vicinity
but these warnings said that if nothing happened then the chances of a major earthquake would recede to normal for the vicinity
the trouble was the area was more prone to quakes at this time than any other place in the bay area on the san andreas fault
only the nearby hayward fault may harbor as great a danger of a catastrophic earthquake in the bay area
the san andreas the longest and bestknown earthquake fault in california extends from point arena in mendocino county to the salton sea
it has been the site of the deadliest and most destructive earthquakes in the states recorded history
although tuesdays quake was powerful waverly person chief of the national earthquake information service in golden colo cautioned that at  magnitude it should be considered only a strong shock not a major one as a quake in the  to  range would be classified or a great one as a quake of  or above would be
person and others in the geological survey warned tuesday night that the probability is  that a temblor more powerful than tuesdays will strike in southern california sometime in the next three decades
but as it was tuesdays quake was about four times stronger than the devastating sylmarsan fernando earthquake of  and  times stronger than the  whittier quake
each point of magnitude represents a fold increase in the power of an earthquake
person said that like most san andreas earthquakes this was most likely to be a strikeslip quake with one side of the fault grinding horizontally past another
but he said a final evaluation would have to await onscene inspection teams that will be sent into the epicenter area today by the geological surveys menlo park office
jim dewey a research geophysicist at the national earthquake center said preliminary evaluations indicated that the fracture was about  miles deep and that the quake rupture extended about  miles south down the fault from the epicenter
person said that the area of strongest shaking was around santa cruz although this evaluation too will have to await field evaluations as will a final confirmation of the magnitude of the earthquake
the nearest metropolitan area to tuesdays earthquake san jose has seen nearly a dozen earthquakes of  magnitude or greater in the last  years but several of them have been on the calaveras fault which generally runs just east of san jose more than  miles east of san andreas at this point
scientists do not yet understand whether the quakes on the calaveras fault may have been a precursor or somehow added pressure on the san andreas
but when a  earthquake did strike on the calaveras in  some earthquake scientists expressed concern that this could be the case
between the late s and  there were no quakes of magnitude  or larger near the bay area
but in august  a magnitude quake struck under coyote lake east of gilroy and south of san jose and since then there have been a number of quakes
in august geological survey scientists had expressed concern at the stepup in magnitude quakes south of the bay area
they noted that a similar series of moderately strong quakes had preceded the san francisco quake of 
meanwhile a new mexico scientist who studies tidal forces supported by two eyewitnesses said tuesday night that at a private lecture in san francisco on oct  he had stated that a strong quake in the vicinity was probable on or about oct 
iben browning of sandia park n m said he had based his prediction on an assessment of tidal forces caused by the moons relationship with the earth
he said he had decided to keep the assessment private because he feared that publicity about it would cause people to panic

in a dramatic finish the san francisco ers football team won the super bowl on sunday with a  victory over the cincinnati bengals
joe montanas yard touchdown pass to john taylor with  seconds left provided the winning margin

rice was named the games most valuable player
the winning score came at the end of a yard drive engineered by montana whose touchdown pass gave him a super bowl record with  yards passing

three of president bushs ambassadorial nominees whom democrats said had no qualifications except political connections won narrow approval tuesday from the senate foreign relations committee
sen charles s robb dva joined the republican members as the panel first voted  to  to send to the senate floor the nomination of florida real estate developer joseph zappala to be ambassador to spain
then in voice votes the committee approved the equally controversial nominations of florida real estate developer marvin sembler to be ambassador to australia and della newman a seattle wash real estate broker to be ambassador to new zealand
robb said later that he was troubled over zappalas quite thin qualifications for the job but that he felt he had made an implicit commitment to vote for the nominee when he interviewed him may  and did not clearly indicate that he would oppose him
sen paul s sarbanes dmd
 who led the opposition to the nominations vowed to carry the fight to the senate floor
one looks through this resume wondering why this person has been appointed to this position sarbanes said of zappala
the answer is to be found in the appendix which lists the campaign contributions
zappala reported to the committee that he contributed  last year to republican campaigns and gave  in the previous two years
his prior governmental experience described on the ambassadorial evaluation form submitted to the committee consisted mainly of chairing campaign finance committees for president bush and the republican party
other approvals in other action the committee routinely approved the nomination of shirley temple black to be ambassador to czechoslovakia
it also approved the nominations of thomas melady to be ambassador to the vatican william howard taft iv to be the permanent us representative on the council of the north atlantic treaty organization keith l brown to be ambassador to denmark and joseph gildenhorn a washington lawyer and real estate developer to be ambassador to switzerland

im shocked
its just horrible
i dont understand why and i probably wont ever know why said ms chumbley a yearold retired cannery worker
it troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can happen
its like a nightmare
this sort of thing happens to others not you
your own grandson
stockton is about  miles southwest of lodi
punzel said purdys aunt julie michael told me he was a loner and as a child he was an alcoholic
mrs michael said through a closed front door at her residence that she was too upset to talk to reporters

the un security council today swiftly condemned iraqs invasion of kuwait demanding an unconditional withdrawal of iraqi troops and calling for immediate negotiations between the countries
the iraqi envoy said his countrys troops would withdraw as soon as the situation is stable perhaps within a few days or some weeks
the security council resolution was adopted  in an emergency session requested by the united states and kuwait hours after todays predawn invasion
neither kuwait nor iraq is on the member council
the representative of yemen said he did not vote because he had not received instructions from his government
britains un envoy crispin tickell condemned the invasion as an ugly moment in world affairs
kuwait is a former british colony
the united states has made it clear that it will stand shoulder to shoulder with kuwait in this time of crisis us
ambassador thomas pickering told the council
it is our understanding that the present aggression was completely unprovoked
baghdad radio claimed iraq had come to the aid of revolutionary youth in kuwait whom it said had toppled the kuwaiti government
kuwaits ambassador to the united nations mohammad abulhasan denied the invasion was in response to a call from help from a new government
the pretext to invade an independent sovereign state is a false flimsy pretext he said
this kind of pretext if its not going to be deterred in a decisive manner and by this august assembly all international relations will be threatened
no country at all will be safe after this
a statement read by sabah talat kadrat iraqs deputy permanant representative said iraqs forces would withdraw when what it referred to as the free kuwaiti interim government requested it
the iraqi statement was also reported by the iraqi news agency in baghdad
the security council resolution said the council supports all efforts for negotiations between iraq and kuwait
it specifically endorsed mediation efforts by the arab league which met in emergency session in cairo today
the iraqi invasion posed a breach of international peace and security the security council said
kadrat said the events were related to an internal matter that was not the councils concern
the iraqi government firmly believes and states that iraq is pursuing no goal or objective and wishes only cordial relations with kuwait said kadrat
furthermore it is the kuwaitis themselves who will determine their own future and iraqi forces will withdraw as soon as order has been restored
members of the member security council began gathering at the united nations shortly after midnight
diplomats held more than three hours of private consultations before convening the formal meeting
kuwaiti spokesman nasser alsabeeh said before the formal meeting that kuwait wants negotiations with iraq to be mediated by the arab league
but if its necessary then we would seek un mediation he said
two weeks ago president saddam hussein of iraq threatened military action with kuwait over its violation of opec oil production ceilings and a disputed border oil field
saddam also has accused some persian gulf nations of conspiring with the united states and israel to weaken iraqs economy and undermine its military buildup
todays resolution was sponsored by canada colombia ivory coast ethiopia finland france the united states britain and malaysia
the  members of the security council are china yemen romania the soviet union cuba canada colombia ivory coast ethiopia finland france the united states the united kingdom malaysia and zaire

we want to be helpful without regard for our political differences with iran he said
there have been only rare instances of usiranian cooperation since the two countries broke diplomatic relations a decade ago
the united states holds iran partly responsible for the continued detention of american hostages by proiranian groups in lebanon
boucher said iran told the us government that private donor agencies should contact the iranian red crescent a humanitarian group that is the conduit for all outside assistance
the us government routinely channels humanitarian assistance through the red cross and other donor groups
boucher said the iranian message to the united states presumably was delivered through a third party but added that he was uncertain
messages between the two countries normally are handled by the swiss embassy in tehran
iranian authorities have told united nations officials that about  people died in the earthquake
iran reportedly said it would accept aid from all countries  including iraq  but excluded israel and south africa
rescuers in iran today freed thousands of people from buildings flattened by the earthquake in northern iran which struck early thursday and had a magnitude between  and 
the islamic republic news agency said  people were pulled from rubble and airlifted from the stricken gilan and zanjan provinces to hospitals
iranian television showed scenes of devastation including the remains of an entire row of hillside village houses that collapsed and slid down the hill
rescuers scooped up rubble and used police dogs to find victims
they gently fed water to one man who was trapped in a mass of stones and earth only his head protruding
the iranian red crescent asked for help in providing shelter for  people left homeless by the earthquake
offers of help came from across the globe
the death toll was higher than a quake that killed  people in nearby soviet armenia in december  and a quake in iran in  that also killed 
in scenes shown on television masked rescuers in white aprons pulled dustcovered bodies from under concrete slabs
corpses were laid on blocks of ice in open trucks
the staterun television interviewed one middleaged man from roodbar a mountainside village in gilan province who said he was sleeping when the temblor struck
it was so strong he said
i was thrown several meters i ended up by the olive trees outside his home
then a big boulder hit the house
the house collapsed
i lost all four of my children

the greenhouse effect may breed bigger and deadlier hurricanes in the future storms up to  percent stronger than hugo and last years recordsetting gilbert some meteorologists say
hugo blasted the eastern caribbean and the carolinas with  mph winds this past week killing at least  people
just before hugo struck the us coast its pressure was measured at  millibars
that made it among the  strongest hurricanes this century to hit the united states the national hurricane centers miles lawrence said today
gilbert whose winds reached  mph tore up the caribbean last year killing  and causing  billion damage
it was the most powerful hurricane ever recorded
gilbert seems to be about the upper limit of a hurricane with current ocean temperatures said kerry emanuel of the meteorology department at the massachusetts institute of technology
but if the seas warm up say by  to  degrees fahrenheit the wind speeds might be  percent higher  which means the destructive force would be more like  percent higher he said
stephen schneider deputy director of the national center for atmospheric research in denver said his research suggests the warming trend is already here
schneider an expert on the greenhouse effect and author of a new book global warming said six of the  hottest years in the last  occurred in the s
he projects that the s will be even hotter
hugo demonstrated the effect of warm atlantic waters when its winds jumped from  mph to  mph as it passed over the gulf stream before hitting the east coast schneider said
youll get worse hurricanes if the caribbean is warmer he said
and i think there are betterthaneven odds that you will have stronger hurricanes
emanuel said if the ocean temperature climbs moderate hurricanes of the future could grow to gilberts strength  and future gilberts will be even stronger
gilbert was so strong that bob sheets director of the national hurricane center said forecasters may have to use an intensity scale of  in the future instead of the current  with five the highest
the computer models schneider uses show that in a worstcase scenario over the next  years the worlds temperature could jump by  degrees if carbon dioxide and methane gas  which both contribute to the greenhouse effect  continue to pour into the atmosphere unchecked
it is possible that even though the world as a whole heats up the caribbean could somehow remain cooler
but he said that is unlikley
thats not what the models are showing schneider said
and thats another reason id like to slow down global warming
family members on saturday grieved for their slain loved ones and criticized the security arrangements at the royal marines music school where an ira terrorist attack killed  military musicians
jean cleatheroe whose son andrew was killed joined local residents and opposition politicians in denouncing the use of private security firms to protect the music school and  other military establishments in britain
the security at those barracks was absolutely abysmal
we had seen it for ourselves
we have always said how easy it would be for anyone to get in  what could ordinary security men do to stop terrorists
she said
british military installations are a frequent target of the iras campaign to end british rule in northern ireland and unite the predominantly protestant province with the mainly roman catholic republic of ireland
fridays attack was the worst since july  when  servicemen were fatally wounded in bombings in central london
shocked residents of deal gathered outside the barracks to lay flowers in tribute to the young men they called the bandies
an yearold royal marines cadet in full dress uniform marched to the barracks and smartly saluted the royal marines sign
im proud of my uniform and im proud of all the marines i knew
i hate the people who did this to them said scott roberts
archbishop of canterbury robert runcie spiritual leader of the church of england visited the injured and said he was impressed by their strength and determination that evil will not defeat them
runcie said one of the mens main concerns was that their hands would heal properly so they could continue playing their musical instruments
police investigating the attack were searching a nearby house that had been rented briefly by three men with irish accents
we know when the men arrived and when they left cmdr
george churchillcoleman head of scotland yards antiterrorist squad said at a news conference
it appears the men left several days before the explosion
he said the house which overlooks the barracks recreation center destroyed by the friday morning blast was rented by its english owners to three men for two to three weeks
there was no proof the house was an ira hideout the commander said
by virtue of the fact that the house is very near the base and the men are irish we are very anxious to talk to them he said
explosives experts wearing white protective overalls were painstakingly examining the house saturday and churchillcoleman said they would continue for the next two or three days
police said all  men killed during a coffee break between morning band practices were servicemen
of  men injured  remained hospitalized saturday five in serious condition
the irish republican army on friday claimed responsibility for the explosion which also severely damaged several nearby houses
police have not determined what caused the blast but churchillcoleman said it would seem to be some form of improvised device using high explosives
the ira did not specify how it caused the blast
ronald i spiers a veteran us diplomat will be the new undersecretarygeneral for general assembly affairs the topranking american post at the world body un officials said tuesday
spiers was ambassador to pakistan from  and has served as ambassador to the bahamas and turkey
he replaces joseph verner reed a banker who served in the post from  until leaving last winter to become chief of protocol for the united states

mcdonalds hamburgers fries and golden arches came to china on monday when the fastfood chain opened its first restaurant in a nation famed for its distinctive cuisine
hundreds of chinese waited for hours outside the restaurant in shenzhen an economic boom town near hong kong for their first taste of a mcdonalds hamburger fries or shake
i travelled for four hours from a village to get here said huang rongti  who has lost most of her teeth because of age
you think hamburgers are too challenging for my age
later after purchasing her first big mac she inspected it carefully before taking a bite
it tastes good i like it she announced before slowly eating the rest
the opening of a us fastfood restaurant in china where cooking has long been considered a culinary art may seem odd to gourmets
it is estimated there are more than  different chinese dishes
in canton  miles northwest of shenzhen chefs specialize in some of the more exotic chinese dishes such as cat stew bear paws chicken feet and a famed snake dish  dragon and tiger locked in battle  made from three kinds of poisonous snakes stewed with leopard meat and garnished with  spices lemon leaves and chrysanthemum petals
however many chinese who earn an average  a month are still unable to afford fancy meals at restaurants
in shenzhen a chinese special economic zone where foreign investors have built factories salaries are higher and workers earn an average of  a month
at the restaurant a big mac costs  a bag of fries  cents and a shake  cents
another us fast food outlet kentucky fried chicken opened a restaurant in beijing in  and it now has four outlets there
mcdonalds hopes to open a restaurant in beijing later
although kentucky fried chicken has become popular the average chinese still regards a meal there as a treat rather than a convenience and mcdonalds could face the same problems
the seat mcdonalds restaurant in a threestory building is operated by mcdonalds restaurant shenzhen ltd a wholly owned subsidiary of mcdonalds hong kong
mcdonalds hong kong is a  joint venture with mcdonalds in the united states
it is managed by a chinese national chen tikang and his son chen yin who is the restaurant manager
the younger chen returned recently from a course at mcdonalds hamburger university in oak brook ill
most of the ingredients used at the restaurant are now imported from hong kong
but mcdonalds executives hope eventually to get their supplies of beef and potatoes from china
daniel ng chairman of mcdonalds restaurant shenzhen ltd said it took two years to prepare for the restaurants opening and his ambition now is to serve  million burgers a year
last month when mcdonalds advertized for  staffers for the restaurant it received applications from more than  persons including college graduates officials said
i feel i have a better job prospect working here and it pays better said henry he  who has a masters degree in garment and textile
he is an assistant manager at the restaurant
a waiter at the restaurant can earn  cents an hour
a factory worker who waited several hours before she was able to purchase her hamburger said she liked it because of its sweet taste  the result of tomato ketchup which is not commonly used in traditional chinese cooking
a drug that eases the hearts workload can cut the risk of new cardiac attacks and death by  percent in people recovering from heart attacks according to a major study released thursday
the study conducted in denmark found that the drug verapamil known as a calcium channel blocker was effective for the  years after a heart attack
calcium blockers are among several classes of medicines commonly prescribed to relieve high blood pressure
this is the first trial that indicates that a calcium blocker may be beneficial after an acute myocardial infarction or heart attack said dr carl j pepine of the university of florida
several other studies of calcium blockers including one large us study published last year failed to find any benefit from using the medicines after heart attacks
according to the danish study verapamil is about as effective as another variety of blood pressure medicines known as beta blockers at protecting people after heart attacks
while calcium blockers may not replace beta blockers after heart attacks the researchers said these drugs still should have a role in treatment
we feel it is important to have alternatives
many patients do not tolerate beta blockers said dr kresten mellemgaard of central county hospital in hillerod denmark a coauthor of the study
beta blockers are generally not recommended for people with asthma and emphysema
this means the drugs often cannot be given to cigarette smokers who are frequent victims of heart attacks
in the study conducted at  community hospitals doctors compared  patients who got verapamil after heart attacks with  people who took placebos
after  months of followup there were  deaths or recurring heart attacks among the verapamil patients compared with  in people who got the dummy medication
we wanted to see if an effect would be observed with verapamil said dr forgen fischer hansen of copenhagen municipal hospital
if it had an effect it should be seen in the first  to  months because there is a big increase in mortality in myocardial infarction in this period he said
then it levels off
thats what we demonstrated
it worked
the researchers believe that by reducing the amount of work needed by the heart to sustain circulation calcium blockers lowered the chances of ischemia episodes in which the hearts own muscle is deprived of oxygen
they said they were unsure why earlier studies failed to show any benefit from calcium blockers after heart attacks
however they noted that some studies enrolled patients who were also taking beta blockers
and this might have obscured any benefits from calcium blockers
the results were presented at a meeting of the american college of cardiology
among other research described at the meeting dr
james h chesebro of the mayo clinic said a fiveyear study found that aspirin does not stop the continued buildup of existing blockages in the arteries feeding the heart although it may modestly protect against the development of new deposits
however like other studies this one found that aspirin signficantly cut the risk of heart attacks
dr
eugene braunwald of harvard medical school said the next phase of a large study of clotdissolving drugs will see what effect they have in unstable angina
this is a condition in which people suffer spontaneous chest pain that is not triggered by work or stress
until now the drugs have been used only to treat heart attacks
a crowd the size of a small city will squeeze past a starting line here march  to run  miles  yards
and cheering every step of that distance will be more than a dozen corporate sponsors and licensees
makers of cars soda pop sportswear copiers computers  even a hospital  have tagged their names to the los angeles marathon
in the promoters words this run is a marketing event on legs reflecting marathonings growing importance in upscale product promotions
runners it seems are a wellheeled lot
a study by mercedesbenz found that  of family heads making  a year or more jog regularly
of potential buyers showing up at mercedes dealers  are joggers
with those numbers in mind the car maker has become a sponsor of three marathons  in new york boston and los angeles  as well as other running races
marathons have had corporate backing for some time
but los angeles is ahead of the pack in making distance running a commercial spectacle
the city that invented the corporatesponsored olympics has created a marathon unlike others  artfully dressed as an olympictype amateur race but built from the ground up to make money for the closely held company that controls it  as well as for the city
i took air and made an event says william burke the founder and president of los angeles marathon inc for a man whose running days ended with his high school track team mr burke is turning a lot of heads in the world of marathoning
last year its first time out the los angeles race attracted nearly  runners  four times the number forecast and enough to make it the third  largest race in the us
the event also pulled in about  million in cash and services from its sponsors leaving the organizers with  in red ink
this year mr burke and his partner marie patrick expect to gross about  million in cash and services and to break even
next year they say a profit is possible
more than  runners are expected this year
an audience of perhaps a million and a half or more will line the route drawn in part by advertisements on  million cocacola cans and  billboards around the los angeles area
marketing experts say the festive atmosphere of big crowds in the streets makes marathons attractive to sponsors
for the cost of a second ad on the super bowl a company can sponsor a marathon and take over a city says lesa ukman editor of special events reports a chicagobased newsletter
the los angeles organizers and sponsors have perhaps done more than their counterparts elsewhere to publicize the event
los angelenos are seeing plugs for the race on millions of grocery bags milk cartons and loaves of bread in addition to soda cans billboards and other sources
the venerable new york marathon is taking note
the new york road runners club organizer of the race stopped promoting the event some years ago because it had all the runners it wanted
now fred lebow the groups president says he is encouraging sponsors to promote the race as the los angeles sponsors do
the promotion in los angeles is unabashed
we tell people that if theyre looking for a new way to crack the los angeles market this is it says mr burke
the pitch has attracted the likes of cocacola bottling co of los angeles vons cos a large supermarket chain the los angeles times the sears savings bank unit of sears roebuck co eastman kodak co and tandem computers inc one supporter is ellesse usa a sportswear and shoe producer
a  fee enables the company to use the marathons name in its ads ellesse will spend an additional  dressing race personnel in tshirts and warmup suits showing its clothes at the marathons public expo of sponsors wares and posting a dozen big street banners along the course
the company has rented more than  billboards at a cutrate price of  from patrick media group a marathon sponsor
the discount about  was important
we couldnt have bought that kind of exposure normally says susan cialone ellesses advertising director
ellesse which also sponsors the new york run finds the west coast event more freewheeling
they have let us do whatever we want says ms cialone
for instance product banners along the route  almost impossible to arrange in new york  are a snap in los angeles
the city in fact is a partner in the race
after competitive bidding it awarded an eightyear contract to los angeles marathon inc to put on the race
the exclusive franchise calls for the race organizers this year to pay a minimum  fee or  of gross cash receipts to the city
the organizers also will pay the cost of city services for the marathon estimated at 
the race sponsors and city officials are trading freely on the good will generated by los angeless role as host of the  olympics
the logo of the marathon is a shield with laurel wreath
some posters show the los angeles coliseum with its torch and giant olympic symbol
the world returns to los angeles proclaims one mercedesbenz ad
race directors are called commissioners a term borrowed from the  olympic organization in which mr burke was commissioner of tennis
and like the olympics los angeles marathon inc portraying the race as a civic celebration thrives on volunteers
some  people will work for free to monitor the course on race day
and twothirds of the races office staff work without pay
i couldnt buy this mr burke says gesturing around the crowded race headquarters
not everyone works for free
bigname runners for instance want to be paid a lot
and here the organizers have pinched pennies
while some runners will be paid to appear this years field like last years lacks some of the superstars who race in boston new york and london
grete waitz one of the best woman marathoners wanted  to appear in los angeles she was turned down
mr burke says the australian runner rob de castella made it known through his agent that he wouldnt run any marathons in the spring but for  hed be happy to say the los angeles event was tempting
mr burke says he slammed down the phone
we wont spend extraordinary amounts of money on any single runner to the detriment of the other runners he says
mr de castellas agent denies the story entirely
what los angeles lacks in superstars it plans to make up for in numbers
this years race may challenge new york and london as the largest marathon ever run
some  started the new york race last year
mr lebow organizer of the new york event says next years los angeles marathon will surpass that number
for one sponsor this may be a mixed blessing
orthopaedic hospital a notforprofit institution whose sponsorship is part of a publicity campaign provides emergency care stations along the marathon route
last year one of every  runners needed aid
along with sprains strains and blisters came more serious cases of exhaustion and hypothermia
a spokeswoman says we advised  people to quit the race
kentuckys governor has criticized the federal government for being too slow in dealing with the drought and iowas governor warns that farmers in his state still face potential disaster despite up to five inches of rain over the weekend
crews began installing pumps on barges monday to haul fresh water to southern louisiana towns plagued by rising salt levels in the lower mississippi river
meanwhile house speaker jim wright said in washington he hopes that a relief package with disaster payments of up to  for droughtstricken farmers will win committee approval and be ready for floor action in congress this week
the drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the united states rebuild its grain inventories says agriculture secretary richard e lyng
but the united states will continue to be a major player in world agriculture and in  should be able to bounce back from this years drought losses he said monday
a larger portion of the united states suffered from some degree of drought stress in may and june than at any point since records began in  lyng said

ground controllers at the goddard space flight center finally made contact today with the two main antennas on the  billion hubble space telescope after trying for more than six hours to lock on
applause erupted in the hubble control center in greenbelt md as the glitch that marred hubbles first full day in space was solved
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna system said nasas dave drachlis
engineers had said all along they believed the antennas were working all right and that the problem was in incorrectly pointing either the satellite or the tdrs an orbiting communications satellite that acts as a switchboard
in the successful attempt they nearly doubled the width of the antennas beams to take in more territory from a sweep of  degrees to  degrees
the telescopes lowgain antennas which receive and transmit information at a much slower rate and can be used in emergencies were working well
space shuttle discovery was  miles away available to remedy certain problems
the outage was not a problem for which space walkers would have been summoned
the five astronauts were otherwise busy making pictures of storms over texas from their milehigh perch and doing experiments
steve terry director of a team calibrating various aspects of the telescope said the first outage was caused by human error and was not a serious problem
it began between  and  am edt and lasted  minutes to an hour he said
the second failure occurred at  am when controllers attempted to send a signal to the telescopes two highgain antennas through the tdrs
this time it was a pointing problem said jim elliott a goddard spokesman
its a new spacecraft and we think inexperience dealing with it was the cause
the telescope embarking on a year search for new worlds was released from the shuttles cargo bay wednesday after a lastminute snag that almost sent two astronauts on an emergency spacewalk
mission control awakened the crew early today with a loud rendition of the song shout a fraternity house favorite
good morning discovery
i guess youre awake after that song said kathy thornton shuttle communicator
there are a lot of happy people down here
we saw a great deploy yesterday and hubble had a good night while you were asleep
we appreciate the good words from everybody replied discovery commander loren shriver
after wednesdays deployment shriver gently backed discovery away from the telescope and put the shuttle through a series of maneuvers the last one completed this morning to park discovery in orbit  miles behind hubble
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work shriver said wednesday
well it sure is now loren and thanks for all the great work youve done replied mission control
galileo is real proud of you
scientists have hailed the hubble  nasas most expensive unmanned spacecraft  as the greatest advance in astronomy since galileo raised a small telescope to his eyes nearly  years ago
discovery and its five astronauts will follow the telescope while controllers at the goddard center make sure hubble is operating properly such as responding to directional commands
the next milestone is friday when the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
then on tuesday nasa expects to release the first image from the telescope an open star cluster in the constellation carina
data will follow in a month or two
if the aperture door doesnt open properly discovery could return to the telescope so two astronauts could perform a spacewalk to fix it
hubble project manager fred wojtalik said the telescope would be tested today for its ability to maneuver before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
too much light could damage the telescopes sensitive instruments
on wednesday mission specialist steve hawley used the shuttles foot robot arm to gently grasp the ton telescope and hoist it from the cargo bay
one of the telescopes solar arrays unreeled from its mast as expected and started providing power to the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge
but there was trouble with the second panel
it wouldnt budge when the latches were released and then moved about a fifth of its foot length and stopped again
the panel rolled all the way out on the third attempt
by the final attempt astronauts bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were in their space suits in the airlock  minutes away from taking tools in hand and going on an outerspace maintenance call
wojtalik said the cause of the problem is unknown
the hour procedure was performed  miles above earth  miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown
the orbit was dictated by the need to put hubble above the earths distorting atmosphere
astronomers hope to use the telescope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billions years to reach earth
they hope to determine how and when the universe was formed currently estimated at  billion years ago
the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in  but was delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident
discovery which blasted into orbit tuesday is scheduled to land sunday at edwards air force base calif
soviet president mikhail s gorbachev warned the nation saturday night that the countrys growing ethnic strife is endangering its unity as a state as well as threatening his program of political and economic reforms
appealing for calm and for the cool consideration of grievances after weeks of continuing unrest in scattered areas of the country gorbachev made clear the leaderships fear that the nation is heading into a political maelstrom that could tear the soviet union apart
as president gorbachev said it is his duty to warn you about the mounting danger of worsening interethnic relations and the consequences for society for every family and for every person
the fate of perestroika and the unity of our state is at stake he declared in a sober minute address broadcast on radio and television
irresponsible slogans political instigation setting one national group against another the domination of some ethnic groups by others  this could lead to disaster for us all
the living and the succeeding generations will curse those who pushed the nation on this course and those who failed to caution it against the dangers involved in time to prevent madness
with serious ethnic clashes in soviet central asia over the past month with troops needed to maintain the peace in the southern republics of armenia azerbaijan and georgia and with nationalism growing stronger in the baltic republics of estonia latvia and lithuania gorbachev is struggling to hold the soviet union together as a state while he pushes broad reforms that he believes will resolve most of the grievances
even as he spoke soviet officials reported new violence in the south  this time between georgians and azerbaijanis inside the georgian republic but in an area with many azerbaijanis
roving gangs armed with hunting rifles gasoline bombs and other weapons had clashed in three towns south of the capital of tbilisi last week leaving one man dead and  people seriously wounded
although limited so far in scope some of the ethnic conflicts could grow to the point where various regions of the country would be thrown into virtual civil war gorbachev suggested and some national republics could find themselves in violent disputes with their neighbors
those who encourage the unrest are playing with fire gorbachev said warning that the government will use its full powers and take the most decisive measures against those provoking the clashes organizing attacks on minority groups or urging secession
nearly  people have been killed in communal clashes and related political disturbances over the past two years tens of thousands of people have had to flee their homes including  last month alone to seek refuge from the violence and nearly  special troops are now deployed in various parts of the country to maintain order
there will be no pulling of our punches in relation to those who have taken the criminal path gorbachev said warning of stern measures against those engaged in communal violence or in political agitation
political energy drained the ethnic strife much of it rooted in past soviet policies of domination by ethnic russians or in the forced deportation of hundreds of thousands of people during the stalinist era has increasingly drained the political energy necessary to push through major reforms and has provided conservative critics of reform with a potent argument against faster and broader change
for gorbachev the spread of the unrest has forced the humiliating admission that the soviet union a superpower in world terms cannot ensure the domestic tranquility that is a first priority for any government  nor can it protect its own minorities against pogroms
if the strife here continued and grew he asked what kind of example shall we set for others while calling on the whole of mankind to build a nonviolent world
of equal gravity for gorbachev in domestic political terms has been the growth of not only nationalism but the appearance of secessionist groups in the baltic republics and in armenia georgia and moldavia a soviet republic on the romanian border
the whole issue is believed to have been the subject of a highlevel communist party conference here late last week and gorbachevs unusual television address underscores the threat posed by the conflicts
gorbachev acknowledged that ethnic relations are wound in a tight knot of contradictions because of previous soviet policies particularly the effort to pull the countrys plus ethnic groups into a new soviet nationality with a unified culture
this policy had in fact collided head on with growing ethnic awareness throughout the country and made the problems even worse
past economic policies including the stagnation in many regions under the regime of the late president leonid i brezhnev had also made the problems more acute
we are also reaping today the results of lawlessness in preceding decades  the deportation of whole peoples from their lands and the burying in oblivion of the national interests of small ethnic groups gorbachev said alluding to actions carried out decades ago by the dictator josef stalin
such excesses resulted in indifference to ethnic interests to many outstanding social and economic problems in constituent republics and autonomous regions deformities in the development of the languages and cultures of the countrys different peoples the deteriorating demographic situation and many other negative consequences that ultimately provoked tension in interethnic relations
although these questions will be dealt with during a special meeting of the communist partys policymaking central committee in late july and then debated again by the congress of peoples deputies the countrys new national assembly gorbachev apparently felt that he could not wait for those debates and he set out his own broad guidelines for dealing with the crisis
right of equality everyone regardless of his nationality should feel an equal citizen in any part of the country and have a possibility to exercise all the rights guaranteed by the soviet unions constitution he said
the refusal to recognize the basic principle of equality had led to attacks on minority groups in several parts of the country gorbachev said alluding to the particularly vicious assaults on mesketian turks in uzbekistan last month in which about  people died
the soviet leader outlined an approach that would seek to increase the feeling of various ethnic groups that they are at home in their own land and could preserve and develop their own cultures languages and social traditions with the soviet union evolving politically to be much more of a federal system
but he said that minority communities also need to be protected so that there is a balance of rights
we have lived and will continue to live in a multiethnic community he observed
gorbachev said that profound transformations in the soviet federation are clearly essential promising further political reforms to make it a real federation and not just one in name only
demands rejected but he declared at the same time his firm opposition to neartotal independence demanded by some nationalists particularly in estonia latvia and lithuania and to the calls by others for the redrawing of the borders of ethnic territories
the soviet unions ethnic groups have a common destiny gorbachev said
in quest of the better one should not embark on the path of destroying what has been built and abandoning what has already been given by the federation and what can be multiplied within its framework he said
an antiamerican newspaper in iran said sunday the united states is partly to blame for the death of tens of thousands of people in last weeks earthquake
the criminal role of america in irans past became evident once again in the recent earthquake the jomhuri islami said in an editorial reported by the official islamic republic news agency
our people even under the rubble chant death to america and pray to god to cut off the hands of the united states  even those hands stretched out to help it said
it argued that by plundering irans oil and other resources for  years the united states had prevented the use of even a small part of the national wealth for urban development projects and advanced antiseismic building construction systems
even after its expulsion from iran the us government by imposing economic sanctions and launching several other plots halted the renovation of the country the editorial added
the newspaper was implying that with these actions the united states had blocked the diversion of funds to earthquake safety measures
if the united states has real humanitarian objectives and intended to help the iranian nation it should do only one thing stop hatching plots the newspaper said
it called on iranians to reject relief offers by the united states and other governments whose hands are stained with the blood of the iranian people
iran at odds with the united states since the  seizure of hostages at the us embassy in tehran has said it would welcome relief from the american red cross and other us humanitarian groups
the two nations have no diplomatic ties
five astronauts boarded discovery today for a second try at sending the hubble space telescope into orbit to scan the outermost reaches of the universe for clues to the beginning of time
astronomers are starting to tingle again in anticipation of what the hubble will be able to accomplish said lennard fisk head of nasa science activities
air force forecasters said there was a  percent chance the weather would be favorable for launching the shuttle at the scheduled time of  am edt
more than a half million gallons of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen were pumped into the space ships fuel tanks after midnight
the astronauts wearing bright orange flight suits climbed into the crew cabin just as dawn was breaking over the kennedy space center
the  billion telescope nasas costliest cargo will give astronomers a new set of eyes and ears that we dont have said william lenoir head of nasas space flight program
its going to change our perspective altogether
i cant say what were going to learn but ill be astounded if we dont learn many new things
discovery was aiming for an altitude of  miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere
it is the th shuttle mission
columbia which journeys into space next month with the astro observatory sat on a launch pad  miles from discovery only the second time both pads have been occupied the first was in  just before the challenger explosion
hubble has been waiting to take its place in space since  delayed by technical problems and the challenger accident
the latest postponement occurred april  when discoverys launch was scrubbed four minutes before liftoff because of a faulty power unit on the shuttle
the mood at the kennedy space center was considerably less festive than during the first launch attempt when hundreds of astronomers gathered with their families
the day after launch mission specialist steven a hawley will use the shuttles mechanical arm to lift the pound telescope into space
veteran spacewalkers bruce mccandless ii and kathryn sullivan will assist if a problem develops
discovery will follow hubble from  miles away for two days until after its lens cap is opened exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
hubble is not expected to start providing scientific data by satellite for a month or more after liftoff
however nasa said it will release its first image  an open star cluster in the constellation carina  a week after launch
in addition to the  billion cost of hubble  million has been spent on spare parts astronaut training and computer software to operate the instrument
the european space agency contributed  million for  percent of the viewing time
nasa estimates it will cost  million a year to operate and maintain the telescope in space
during its year working lifetime the telescope will provide astronomers with  times better resolution and  times more sensitivity than groundbased observatories
as a result they will be able to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling toward earth for  billion years
astronomers hope to learn whether the universe was created  billion years ago as believed and uncover some of the mystery surrounding galaxies black holes and quasars
hubble also is expected to shed light on how and when the universe might end
the telescope is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s that the universe is expanding
his work gave rise to the big bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion
in addition to hubble discovery carries a human skull filled with sensors to measure the space radiation that astronauts receive
it is the skulls third trip into space
the shuttle is to end its fiveday mission with a landing at edwards air force base calif
presidents famous actors television executives neighbors and tourists all had their memories
some had known her most had not
in form their sentiments ranged from flowers to telegrams to handlettered signs
through them all ran a single constant thread
they all said they loved lucy and theyll miss her

after years of delay and a lastminute snag the hubble space telescope was freed from the shuttle discovery on wednesday and glinting in the sunlight drifted into orbit on its year search for new worlds
mission specialist steven hawley released hubble from the end of the shuttles footlong mechanical arm after a delay in getting one of the telescopes solar wings unfurled
the first of nasas great observatories is now on station at  nautical miles above the earth mission controls jeffrey carr said
the telescope really looked great as we flew away from it and we sure hope it does good work discovery commander loren j shriver said later
the  billion telescope was released at  pm edt as the shuttle entered its th orbit of earth nearly two hours and one orbit later than planned
the shuttle then backed away
thank you very much for the ride said mike harrington director of orbital verifications at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan had been in the shuttles airlock ready to walk inspace to free the solar panel
that proved to be unnecessary
close but no cigar but better for the hubble that it went the way it did sullivan said
she and mccandless had trained for nearly five years to make such a rescue mission
the first solar array unreeled from its mast at midday wednesday as the shuttle passed  statute miles or  nautical miles above south americas eastern coast
it started providing power to the telescopes batteries which otherwise had only eight hours of charge
deployment of the starboard panel however was more troublesome
it wouldnt budge when latches were first released then moved about a fifth of its foot length and stopped again
a third attempt rolled the panel out all the way
houston we see motion commander loren j shriver reported
hawley began the long process of releasing hubble shortly after  am edt when he grasped it with discoverys footlong mechanical arm and carefully hoisted the ton telescope high above the shuttle
hubble was taken off shuttle electrical power just before it was lifted out of the cargo bay and was operating on its own nickelhydrogen batteries
at one day seven minutes into the flight of discovery hubble is now on its own internal power carr said
the game has begun
the race is on
the clock is ticking
worries that the telescopes instruments would be starved for electricity eased after the first solar panel was stretched out
television cameras aboard discovery showed the first array as it was pulled from its reel slowly but steadily the sun reflecting off the goldcolored panel and silvery telescope
discovery was  statute miles above earth  miles higher than any shuttle has ever flown
the orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the earths distorting atmosphere
discoverys five astronauts were awed by the view
id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today shriver said of hawley
astronomers have waited seven years for hubble to take its place in space
the telescope originally was scheduled for launch in  but technical problems and the challenger explosion pushed it back
the mission was delayed another two weeks when a faulty power unit on discovery forced the national aeronautics and space administration to halt the first launch attempt four minutes before april s scheduled liftoff
on tuesday discovery finally blasted into space transporting hubble out of this world and in search of others
the telescopes foot aperture door is to be opened friday exposing the finely polished inch mirror to starlight
discovery was following hubble in case the door does not open properly
if a problem develops mccandless and sullivan will be prepared once again to walk in space
fred wojtalik hubble project manager said the telescope would be tested thursday for its ability to maneuever before the aperture door is opened
we want to be in full control so we dont ever endanger the hubble by putting the aperture door close to the sunlight he said
the telescope cannot focus into the sun because of the sensitivity of its five instruments
if all goes well the crew will land sunday at edwards air force base calif nasa expects to release its first image from the telescope  of an open star cluster in the constellation carina  on tuesday
data will follow in a month or two
astronomers hope to look back to almost the beginning of the time studying stars and galaxies so distant their light has been traveling to earth for  billion years
they expect to determine precisely how and when the universe was formed currently estimated at  billion years ago
the telescope is named for the late american astronomer edwin p hubble who discovered during the s that the universe was expanding
he also was responsible for helping to form the big bang theory of creation
iranian editorial writers are rejoicing now that the world is waking up to one of their most hated bogeymen iraqi president saddam hussein
a monday headline we warned you frankenstein would torment his own creators
saddam attacked iran in september  after a series of border skirmishes spawning a war that dragged until an august  ceasefire
the conflict has still not formally ended
irans late fundamentalist patriarch the ayatollah ruhollah khomeini vowed for years to unseat saddam
never at a loss for a vivid phrase he compared accepting the ceasefire with saddam to drinking poison
the status of great satan was reserved for the united states the allencompassing public enemy no
 for the islamic republic
iran frequently accuses both the us and saddam of trying to undermine the islamic revolution
saddam conveniently boasts of having alone staunched the tide of radical islam
in fact one of his reasons for invading kuwait on thursday the iraqi press noted was its gall in demanding back tens of billions of dollars loaned to iraq during the war saddam says he fought for all arabs
over the past six months successful unsponsored efforts toward facetoface negotiations between iraq and iran robbed iranian newspapers and television commentators of a favorite target
saddams overthrow of the emir of kuwait changed all that
old scores came brimming to the surface
kuwait after all reflagged tankers in the united states during the iraniraq war ushering in the reason for the arrival of the us navy in the persian gulf in force
irans official islamic republic news agency printed excerpts mondya of an editorial from the ettelaat newspaper that was headlined foster child turns rapaciously on nourisher kuwait
it noted that kuwait had blindly supported iraq little knowing that it was feeding a wild beast in her own neighborhood
saddam has also been called generalissimo and the invader
under the frankenstein headline irna said in its own commentary for the time being tiny kuwait  breathes no more
with its sheikh a stateless person and its powerful dinar which bankrolled the iraqi military mere garbage kuwait is a nonentity swallowed up by the dangerous pet it reared
despite all the attention to the dangerous pet the great satan has not been forgotton
according to irans pundits the great satan planned it all
it wanted to get the navy back in the persian gulf
john major endorsed by margaret thatcher as the politician closest to her heart was elected by the conservative party tuesday night to succeed her as prime minister
major  fell two votes short of winning a majority in voting among the  coservative party members of parliament but his two opponents quickly conceded defeat and the party confirmed major as the winner
mrs thatcher ending  years in power intended to submit her resignation to queen elizabeth ii on wednesday morning and major would then be called to lead the government
major the chancellor of the exchequer emerged from his official residence at  downing st tuesday night smiling and holding hands with his wife norma
inside mrs thatcher who came next door from the prime ministers  downing street residence embraced major
i am thrilled and delighted that john major is to succeed me the iron lady said in a statement released by aides
it is a very exciting thing to become leader of the conservative party and particularly exciting i think to follow one of the most remarkable leaders the conservative party has ever had major said
our job now i think is quite clear
we are going to unite totally and absolutely and were going to win the next general election said major who will be the youngest british prime minister in this century
major received  votes two short of a majority
former defense secretary michael heseltine received  and foreign secretary douglas hurd had 
hurd and heseltine conceded within minutes and party officials declared major elected
the party had been torn by the sudden and unexpected leadership challenge by heseltine who last week stopped mrs thatcher short of victory in the first round of the leadership race
mrs thatcher had not wanted to leave office but she decided to resign last week after she was unable to put down heseltines challenge
she said she resigned to let someone from the cabinet stand against heseltine
major and foreign secretary douglas hurd both joined the race but before the vote her aides spread the word that she was backing major
the son of a circus performer and at one time a welfare recipient major personifies the values of selfreliance and hard work that mrs thatcher had preached to the nation
his election climaxed a month of british politicsturnedupside down and the western worlds longestserving head of government was driven from office by a revolt in party ranks
heading a government that was trailing the opposition labor party in the polls and suffering a losing streak in local parliamentary elections mrs thatcher lost control of events after her deputy sir geoffrey howe resigned on nov 
howe the fourth cabinet member to resign because of disputes over policy toward the european community shocked the house of commons on nov  by calling mrs thatcher a threat to britains vital interests
the next day heseltine announced he would challenge her
six days later with mrs thatcher at a nation summit in paris officially ending the cold war heseltine polled enough votes to deny her reelection as leader
two days later she decided to resign after party leaders told her she could not win
heseltine  said majors election lays the basis for the unity of our party
hurd said the party needed to unite and john major is the right leader for this task
opposition leaders derided majors election as thatcherism with a different face
the conservatives main rivals the socialist labor party demanded a general election
john major is a thatcherette  that is how he sought election and that is how he got elected said labor party leader neil kinnock
it means that the policies that brought the poll tax recession heavy mortgages and rising unemployment will go on
during his fiveday campaign major had aaid he would review the poll tax an unpopular local tax brought in by mrs thatcher but he gave no other hints of differing with her
while adopting a gentler tone on the contentious issue of britains involvement in europe he shares her opposition to a single european currency and shares her belief in tight restraint on government spending
however he insisted over the weekend i am not running as son of thatcher
i am running as myself with my own priorities and my own programs
majors victory ended a patient fouryear campaign by heseltine to promote himself as a future leader of the party
tomorrow always dawns he said smiling after conceding defeat
major was elected to parliament in  was appointed foreign secretary and then chancellor of the exchequer last year
he moved up quickly in the leadership race
by the weekend opinion polls showed that major was nearly as highly regarded by the public as was heseltine who has been prominent for a decade
major attracted support from figures on the right wing of the conservative party although his friends insisted majors own views were more liberal than many supposed
he described himself as conservative on economic issues but liberal on social issues
the committee will continue to hear testimony for and against thomas at least through the end of the week but the outcome does not seem to be in doubt
several committee members said they expected the committee to recommend by a  or  vote that the senate confirm thomas
regardless of the outcome thomas said on his way out of the hearing i have been treated fairly
 before thomas testimony ended the unflappable yearold federal judge was criticized sometimes in harsh terms by several liberal democrats
they accused him of being evasive and of disavowing many controversial statements he made while an official of the reagan and bush administrations
 thomas repeatedly explained that he made the speeches as an advocate for administration policy acknowledging that they often contained overheated rhetoric
 sen howard metzenbaum dohio said he found it difficult to accept the notion that the moment you put on a judges robe all the views and positions which you held prior to going on the bench just magically disappear
 i want to look into the window of your soul patrick leahy dvt said to thomas
but i find the shade down quite a bit
 sen edward kennedy dmass delivered a long stinging lecture to thomas declaring the vanishing views of judge thomas have become a major issue in these hearings
 kennedy listed  instances in which he said thomas had abandoned or contradicted his previous positions
 kennedy told thomas he had walked away from his record on the right to privacy refused to comment on its application to abortion and asked lawmakers to believe that an intelligent and outspoken person like yourself has never discussed roe vs wade the landmark  abortionrights ruling with another human being
 moderate republican arlen specter of pennsylvania who often casts a swing vote on the committee said he was not troubled by thomas shift toward more moderate views at the hearings
 i believe hes going to be a surprising justice
i dont think you can pigeonhole this man specter said
 if thomas is confirmed as expected he made it clear that for the first time in decades there would be not one justice on the supreme court who is convinced that capital punishment is unconstitutionally cruel
 justice thurgood marshall whom thomas would replace was the last member of the court who opposed the death penalty in all cases
thomas told the judiciary committee that philosophically there is nothing that would bother me personally about upholding it the death penalty in appropriate cases
 after thomas left the hearing room an american bar association evaluation committee told the senators that his articles in law journals were deficient in presentation content scholarship and analysis
 but those limitations were outweighed by his brief but highly satisfactory performance on the court of appeals the committee said noting that we found only one opinion to criticize and many to praise

when you get dynamics change
colenso said however that contributions will surge upward as news spreads of the earthquakes destruction
as  you get the disaster translated into the lives of individuals instead of mass numbers people begin to respond
they relate to that he said
at least  people were reported killed and  injured in the earthquake that struck thursday

us prosecutors pressured japans wartime prime minister gen hideki tojo into changing testimony at his trial to avoid incriminating emperor hirohito in war crimes a television documentary claims
the british broadcasting corp documentary details of which were released wednesday by its maker edward behr said the us prosecutors worked with the emperors aides to find a way to avoid putting hirohito on trial
the documentary challenges hirohitos image as a peaceful man forced to go along with his generals plans and alleges among other things that he must have known about the massacre of at least  chinese at nanking in  because he received regular detailed reports from the china front
knew more than a month in advance of japanese plans to attack the us navy at pearl harbor on dec  
the bbc will show hirohito  behind the myth on jan 
behr is a parisbased journalist
his biography of chinas last monarch was used for the awardwinning film the last emperor
it has been reported previously that american prosecutors wanted to keep hirohito out of the war crimes trial and asked tojo to suggest the emperor had consented reluctantly to the war on the advice of the high command
gen douglas macarthur commander of the us forces occupying japan wrote in his book reminiscences that he fended off pressure from britain and the soviet union to indict hirohito arguing that would touch off a guerrilla war
behr told the associated press in a telephone interview wednesday that the documentary will be shown in the united states by pbs on march 
the bbc has also sold it to australia austria canada hong kong israel korea the netherlands norway spain and sweden
hirohito died saturday at the age of 
the documentary says the decision not to prosecute hirohito came from president harry s truman and that tojos evidence was altered so the emperor would not be incriminated

mikhail s gorbachev on friday proposed tougher legislation to punish soviets who seek to kindle ethnic unrest saying nationalist passions benefit opponents of his reforms
the soviet leader told a meeting of the communist party leadership that interethnic relations were worsening in some regions of the country due in part to active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups
perestroika or restructuring is gorbachevs program for widespread economic and social change
staterun media also indicated friday that a crackdown had begun on people in armenia who continue to agitate for annexation of a mostly armenian enclave in the neighboring republic of azerbaijan
the sixmonth conflict between the two republics over control of the nagornokarabakh district has led to mass rallies strikes and ethnic violence since february
the supreme soviet presidium the governments top executive body intervened july 
it rejected any change in nagornokarabakhs status but called for measures to develop the regions economy and culture
the conflict over nagornokarabakh is one of the most rancorous domestic disputes faced by gorbachev since he became communist party chief in march 
he indicated friday he wants to defuse tensions between ethnic groups but also to punish those who transform the tensions into a political crisis
gorbachev spoke before a plenary meeting of the central committee the partys policymaking body
a summary of his remarks was distributed by the official tass news agency
gorbachev outlined the reasons for a current aggravation of tensions between ethnic groups in some regions of the soviet union tass said
among the causes gorbachev listed a lack of concern for many years for the specific requirements of peoples and ethnic groups inadequate control by the masses over the activities of executive personnel and active resistance put up to perestroika by corrupt groups
tass said that after gorbachev noted that nationalist passions benefit all antiperestroika forces he suggested increasing accountability in soviet laws for kindling ethnic strife
tass did not give details of gorbachevs suggestion
at the july  presidium meeting the soviet leader accused corrupt conservatives who oppose his reforms of hiding behind the nagornokarabakh annexation drive
gorbachev said the grounds for tougher legislation come directly from article  of the  soviet constitution which says the law can punish any advocacy of racial or national exclusiveness hostility or contempt
tass said gorbachev made other proposals on how to resolve ethnic tensions including an increase in power for each of the countrys  republics a law on equal use of the more than  languages spoken in the soviet union and some economic autonomy for the countrys republics and regions
in particular the baltic republics of lithuania latvia and estonia forcibly incorporated into the soviet union in  have demanded more say in their own economic and government affairs
the labor newspaper trud said  people in yerevan armenias capital will face criminal charges following an incident in which activists seeking the annexation of nagornokarabakh attached slogans to their cars and drove around the city
the paper did not give the date or size of the mobile demonstration but said  drivers have had their licenses revoked and  were fined
in its july th decision the presidium also ordered local law enforcement agencies to ensure order was restored in the caucasus mountain region
tass reported friday that the situation was stabilizing in armenia but said that at the urging of instigators some strikes and protests were continuing
last year a biography of mrs norma major  or if we are being oldfashioned mrs john major  claimed that the majors favourite film was being there
i entirely concur with their choice
in case you did not see that marvellous film this in essence was the plot a man no one knows anything about a gardener called chauncey rises without trace to become by the end of the film a serious candidate for the us presidency
chauncey played by peter sellers utters only mundane sentiments in a halting monotone but this convinces the republican partys power brokers that he is a surefire winner
in chaunceys bromides everyone seems to hear what they want to believe
he has a deadly innocence
no wonder the majors liked this film
john major must at some level have appreciated the similarity between his own strangely intangible rise and that of chaunceys
if he did not see the similarity that is still more revealing
do not protest that the urban john major could not identify with a gardener
in an interview with farmers weekly a few days ago major disclosed an unknown fact his father was once a farmer
farmers weekly you see had asked major how he had such obvious empathy with agriculture
well it was obvious to farmers weekly anyway
and major replied its simple
my father was a farmer
he lived on a small farm somewhere in shropshire
francis wheen of the guardian a keen student of majors mysterious past immediately rang  downing street which claimed that majors father farmed near bromsgrove in 
as wheen pointed out major was an unresponsive minus  years old at that time and  a minor point this  bromsgrove is not in shropshire
this of course does not mean that major made everything up
family folklore is a peculiar thing
yet when i heard about this my mind immediately went back to an incident a few months ago when major visited pittsburgh centre of the us steel industry as part of his american tour
i recall that he made a great hit by recounting that his father had been a steelworker in the city
a farmer for farmers weekly a pittsburgh steelworker for the american audience 
a pattern emerges
majors father and therefore by extension john major himself can be all things to all people
if john major were a different sort of politician this would be a point barely worth making
but it does seem all of a piece with majors approach to wider political issues
on the one hand he will appeal to the proeuropeans in his own party by claiming to want britain to be at the heart of europe
on the other he is free with insulting references to the european commission whenever it is necessary to appeal to an audience of eurosceptics
there are those who will argue that this merely means that major is a typical democratic politician that one who wants to become prime minister in a democracy must recognise many constituencies of interest not just one
but that has not been true of majors most recent conservative predecessors
margaret thatcher was notoriously dogmatic even in public and so too was edward heath even though he always pretended to be a consensus politician
no majors technique is very much his own invention very much a reflection of his own particular character itself a product of his unsettled family background
his father tom majorball was an itinerant figure moving from place to place trying his hand at any number of occupations including the circus
no wonder the young john major learned the skill of fitting in with prevailing circumstances no matter how fluctuating
the only problem is the old one you cannot fool all of the people all of the time
except in the movies

dan quayles vice presidential nomination was supposed to be a triumph for the precocious young indiana senator but the dream faded overnight
bushs surprise choice for his running mate was supposed to ignite a campaign that has seemed at times to suffer from lack of inspiration but he quickly encountered questions over his military record and suggestions he could best serve the republicans by withdrawing from the ticket
though he found himself in danger of fizzling thursday quayle managed to stir the convention hall with his upbeat speech about family generations and the rosy future he foresaw under a bush administration
lets go on to victory
quayle exhorted as the crowd erupted in cheers
the yearold nominee delivered the speech with calm selfassurance sticking close to his text and avoiding his penchant for extemporaneous remarks  perhaps another result of the unanticipated controversy
bush who followed his running mate to the podium said he was proud to have dan quayle at my side
the two will stress the unity of their ticket as they campaign together this weekend through indiana ohio and illinois
but beyond the optimistic words was an unsettling undercurrent that threatened quayles candidacy just as it was launched
retired maj gen wendell c phillippi  who worked for quayles grandfather eugene c pulliam as managing editor of the indianapolis news  said he contacted the national guard on behalf of quayle when the young man applied in  and recommended him very highly the news reported
quayle a hardliner on defense matters has said he sought guard duty so he could attend law school
a bush aide said the matter was discussed with the indiana senator during the process that led to his selection for the bush ticket and quayle had denied that he used influence to gain admittance to the guard
bush aides said no thought had been given to dropping quayle from the ticket as some republicans suggested
quayle was tense and refused to answer reporters questions about the topic during a brief walkthrough at the convention hall
it was a daunting change for the senator whose youthful vigor rapid political rise striking good looks and wealth have been compared to those of john f kennedy
quayle alluded to the national guard issue during his speech saying he was proud of the six years he served
he also addressed his relative anonymity many this week have asked who is dan quayle
the people of indiana know me and now the nation will
those who addressed the convention on his behalf also pulled out their ammunition
sen bob dole of kansas who placed quayles name in nomination stressed his campaign skills and sought to deflect concerns that he lacked experience for the job
hes already spent  years as a congressman and senator
 that is  more years of national experience than michael dukakis and he is running for president dole said
sen alan simpson of wyoming one of those who seconded the nomination said quayle would bring vim vigor and vitality to the party and would bring sparks and voltage to this campaign
whether quayle can overcome his difficult start on the national ticket remains to be seen
others notably democratic vice presidential nominee geraldine ferraro in  found they could not
but quayle ever upbeat was determined thursday night not to be daunted by the prospect
miracles do happen he told his party
the communist world gets its first mcdonalds next week and some people here are wondering whether its american hamburgers will be as popular as the local fastfood treat pljeskavica
the longawaited opening of the restaurant on one of belgrades main downtown squares will take place march  the yugoslav news agency tanjug reported and it will offer big macs fries and the other specialities familiar to mcdonalds customers in the west
the belgrade media have suggested that the success of the american restaurant depends on its acceptance by yugoslavians who are long accustomed to the hamburgerlike pljeskavica
pljeskavica is made of ground pork and onions and it is served on bread and eaten with the hands
it is sold at fastfood restaurants across the country and costs about a dollar
in fact this is a clash between the big mac and pljeskavica said an official of genex yugoslavias largest staterun enterprise that will operate the mcdonalds
john onoda a spokesman at mcdonalds oak brook ill headquarters said it was the first of the chains outlets in a communist country
the next east european mcdonalds is scheduled to be opened in budapest hungary by the end of this year said vesna milosevic another genex official
negotiations have been going on for years for expanding the fastfood chain to the soviet union but no agreement has been announced
dozens of fans of rock legend and former beatle john lennon gathered in the snow on a windy saturday for a ceremony marking the th anniversary of his death
liverpools mayor dorothy gavin led lennon devotees who laid wreaths at the foot of a bronze statue of the beatles in the citys cavern walks shopping center
the center was built on the original site of the cavern club made famous when the beatles played there in the s and has become a place of pilgrimage
give peace a chance the title of one of singersongwriter lennons greatest hits was the theme for the day
many friends and followers of lennon were present including father tom mckenzie immortalized as father mackenzie in the beatles l hit song eleanor rigby
on friday a small group of invited guests had gathered at liverpools beatles museum to watch mrs gavin unveil a plaque marking the th anniversary of lennons death
john was always a son of liverpool and over the last  years liverpool has been very slow to recognize the fact that the beatles came from liverpool said lennon biographer ray coleman after the unveiling
it is right that a world figure like lennon should be recognized at last said coleman author of john lennon
lennon and his wife yoko ono were returning to their apartment in new yorks dakota apartment building after a recording session on dec   when lennon was shot to death by mark david chapman a deranged fan to whom lennon had given his autograph only hours before
lennon was 
a spokesman for the lennon family said ms ono and the couples son sean were in europe and would spend the anniversary privately
journalist andy peebles the last person to interview lennon before he was shot said in an interview with sky satellitetelevision news ten years on its a ghastly feeling to think that you had spent  seven hours  with somebody you have been a fan of for years and i think i left  thinking this is great hes in really good shape
peebles said late in  that lennon had just recovered from a period when he had gone off the rails and his relationship with ms ono had suffered
but when i saw him theyd had the baby sean had been born and everything was great
griefstricken family and friends mourned the deaths of five school children gunned down during recess while the killer was buried nearly unnoticed in a nearby town
parents and teachers continued counseling the children who witnessed tuesdays schoolyard slayings trying to help them deal with the tragedy
patrick purdy  opened fire outside the cleveland elementary school with an ak semiautomatic assault rifle firing more than  rounds killing five children and wounding  others and one teacher
three days and nights of prayer began thursday for two of the youngsters killed and services for the other children were being held today and monday
gov
george deukmejian was to attend mondays services
purdy was buried friday in nearby lodi said his grandmother julia chumbley
he was interred following a service at cherokee memorial cemetery which several of his relatives attended she said
fourteen of the wounded students were still hospitalized but most were reported in improved conditions
at cleveland school about threequarters of the schools  pupils had returned to classes by friday about three times the number who attended wednesday but it was anything but a routine school day
counselors and school psychologists were assisting teachers in classrooms and some parents sat in with their children to comfort and reassure them
one mother who asked not to be identified told reporters that her youngest son a yearold second grader who was on playground when the shootings occurred would only come back to school if she stayed with him
theyre making it back slowly but surely she said adding that she planned to spend friday as she did thursday at her sons side in the classroom
cleveland school is in the heart of californias thirdlargest community of refugees from southeast asia and nearly twothirds of the schools population is from asia
all of the dead children were from refugee families as were  of the  wounded
school authorities said they were particularly concerned that the killing might not only revive the psychological trauma of the horrors they experienced in southeast asia but that those families might flee from the area without accepting counseling if they feared a racial motive in the attack
we want to pass the word to the community that this is not a racist act 
it could happen to anybody anywhere anytime
this is a crazy action from one individual
it is not racism said an tran of the southeast asian refugee resettlement program
stockton police capt
dennis perry also repeated that there was no evidence that purdy who committed suicide after the attack was specifically targeting asians
it wasnt any one race or group of people
he hated everybody perry said of purdy who as a child  years earlier had attended cleveland school

emperor hirohito left  million in taxable property a tax office near the imperial palace announced monday

germany wants to try him for ordering the shooting of people who attempted to flee to the west during his years in power
but speculation lingers that german politicians have little real interest in trying a man who may possess embarrassing secrets
 lets forget about the issue of erich honecker for several days
lets hope this special issue will be resolved gorbachevs spokesman andrei grachev quoted the soviet president as telling german media
 but tass quoted gorbachev as saying he did not exclude the possibility that honecker would leave russia for north korea in the next few days
 gorbachev had served as honeckers protector until the soviet leaders political fortunes declined
last week russia abruptly ordered honecker to leave the country or face expulsion
 north korean and russian diplomats confirmed that talks were held tuesday about a north korean offer for honecker to travel to pyongyang the north korean capital for medical treatment
 li cher gvan a consul at the north korean embassy said a commercial north korean airliner remained at moscows sheremetyevo airport ready to fly honecker to pyongyang
but he said his country was still awaiting a positive reply from the russian government on the offer to accept honecker
the russian foreign ministry said it had not yet formulated a response
 outside the chilean embassy several dozen demonstrators continued their vigil demanding humane treatment for honecker
flamboyant former defense minister michael heseltines challenge to prime minister margaret thatcher for leadership of the conservative party has caused a political sensation in britain
a crucial first vote of tory members of parliament mps is scheduled for today and if heseltine should wrest control of the party from thatcher  the longestserving british head of government in modern times  she would also have to give up the prime ministers job that she has held since 
heres a sampling of editorial comment on the contest that has stirred britain the thatcher era in british politics is almost over
it is more likely than not that she is finished altogether
the coup de grace may not be delivered at this moment
the nature of the era that comes afterward is far from clear
but as a political force she is condemned at best to an unrelenting rearguard action which will end sometime in a humiliating abyss
the party may sullenly support her now but they will ask the question again in the spring knowing that if they do not do so the country will ask the same question even more pitilessly when the general election comes
an alternative however stares her in the face
it is to acknowledge that an era has passed and preserve its achievements by standing down releasing her lieutenants and urging her party in the interests of a vanished unity to support mr foreign minister douglas hurd
 thatcher biographer hugo young in the guardian the contest for the leadership of the conservative party 
should not be occurring
it would be foolish to deny that today the prime minister is politically beleaguered as never before
but the task of the conservative party in the year and more that remains before the next general election must be to rally to enable mrs thatcher to rebuild her personal position and give her the confidence and support to win the fourth term she deserves
 the daily telegraph who could have guessed 
from watching the prime minister answer questions in the commons that she was fighting for her life
she was as brisk and wellbriefed as ever
bloodied margaret thatcher may be
bowed she most certainly is not
 daily mail british conservative mps must be prepared to reject mrs thatcher when they vote in the partys leadership election
it is no longer in the interests of the united kingdom which are now inextricably linked with the development of a strong and united europe for her to remain in office
the european derives no satisfaction from reaching this conclusion
apart from her domestic achievements in reviving the british economy in the s mrs thatcher has contributed much more to the development of the european community than she is often given credit for
but the european believes that her nightmare vision of europe of illintentioned people trying to destroy democracy is not shared by most of the british people
they reject her view that pooling of sovereignty is no different from surrender
the conservative party faces a stark choice
either it will reelect mrs thatcher and see the united kingdom slip into isolation as it is left behind the rest of the community
or it can choose a new leader who is prepared to participate genuinely in the argument about economic and political union
 the european a prime minister in total command for  years could not be unseated and cherished policies abandoned without an explosion within the party
it would take a solomon to heal the divisions and prevent civil war
frankly we cannot see mr heseltine in that role
the sun also deeply questions his ability to be a successful or even adequate prime minister
this is the man who for the past five years has professed loyalty to the government and yet has been its most divisive force
we discern just one constant loyalty  and that is to michael heseltine
 the sun mrs thatcher deserves better than to be dismissed in the shoddy and demeaning manner some tory mps are minded to have in store for her
to be defeated by the people in a general election as was winston churchill in  that was an honorable rejection
to be brought down by a vote of censure in the house of commons as was neville chamberlain in   even that was a constitutionally respectable form of political demise
but what they are proposing to do to mrs thatcher unquestionably the greatest peacetime prime minister of this century is quite simply unworthy
her fate could be sealed if her opponents have their way behind closed doors in smokefilled rooms
persons of quality were always accorded the dignity of execution by ax or firing squad rather than the humiliation of hanging
these plotters would like to dispatch mrs thatcher who almost singlehandedly has won three elections by the political equivalent of the rope
you can find heseltines wherever you go
but there is only one mrs thatcher
handle with care
this valuable object is irreplaceable
 the sunday telegraph this newspaper has long maintained that the best result in the next general election would be for margaret thatcher to lead the tories to a fourth victory
sadly the course of events has conspired to make that unlikely
the british have never liked margaret thatcher but as long as she delivered the goods they respected her and voted for her
when her government fails as it has recently that lack of affection turns to growing resentment
for reasons that are probably unfair and undeserved mrs thatcher is now a victim of that strongest public mood of all time for a change
mrs thatcher is right to feel bitter that a prime minister with her track record and prestige can be so easily challenged
if she goes the manner of her ousting will leave much to be desired no other party could so lightly dispose of its leader in government this side of an election largely for reasons of unpopularity
but the tories have a nose for survival in power unmatched by any other party in the democratic world and politics is an unforgiving business
the issue before tory mps 
is not the reelection of margaret thatcher it is the defeat of opposition labor party leader neil kinnock
that requires saying a reluctant goodby to mrs thatcher and the endorsement of michael heseltine

ground controllers cheered after reestablishing contact thursday with the  billion hubble space telescope through its main antennas
an attempt six hours earlier had failed
im pretty relieved i must say said al boggess hubble project scientist at goddard space flight center in greenbelt md
applause erupted at goddards space telescope operations control center when the highspeed contact was made thursday afternoon
controllers sent information to the telescope about its location and this basically improved the telescopes knowledge where it was what its position was said goddards dave drachlis
they also widened the radio beam to cover a larger area around the two highspeed dish antennas
we have confirmation that we have achieved communication with the tracking and data relay satellite through the highgain antenna system drachlis reported
the antennas are the primary communications links for relaying scientific information to the ground
controllers lack of experience with the new satellite was part of the problem boggess said
this probably wont be the last time we have a problem he said
well keep working at it until we have all these things that need to be done done
well get them right
the problem began thursday morning when engineers tried pointing the two highspeed antennas toward two widelyseparated tdrs satellites without success
two lowspeed antennas were working fine but boggess said they would be excruciatingly slow for sending data
there had been a communications outage with the telescope earlier
it lasted only  minutes and was due to human error
in addition one of four rate gyros wheels whose spin maintains the telescope in a stable position was disconnected by an automatic system for a reason engineers were unable to explain immediately
but it was restored later and the stability of the satellite was unaffected
the problems wont delay the schedule for putting the telescope into use said jean oliver hubble deputy project manager at marshall space flight center in huntsville ala now we have to do an analysis to make sure ourselves just what part of it worked and whether there are things we have to do differently in the future to make it continue to work boggess said
having done it once weve got confidence we can do it and that means the mission can proceed
space shuttle discovery trailed  miles behind the telescope and was to stay nearby until the hubbles aperture door was opened set for friday morning

in the first eruption of controversy at a confirmation hearing for a bush administration cabinet nominee a prominent conservative told a senate panel tuesday that john tower may lack the moral character to be secretary of defense
over the course of many years i have encountered the nominee in a condition  lack of sobriety  as well as with women to whom he was not married conservative activist paul m weyrich told the senate armed services committee
i encountered it frequently enough to the point where it made an impression he added
criticism from weyrich and other witnesses prompted some committee members to temper the panels earlier praise for the former texas senator
but several members conceded that while their former colleague may not be the ideal candidate for the pentagons top job he probably will win senate approval anyway
weve had a surplus of rumors concerning the nominee and a shortage of witnesses with personal testimony and personal knowledge said committee chairman sam nunn dga
weyrich president of the conservative free congress foundation testified that towers behavior makes him unfit to lead the pentagon into an era of belttightening and management reform
in an extraordinary challenge to towers nomination weyrich also suggested that towers moral shortcomings could make him vulnerable to attempts by foreign governments to bring pressure on the united states government and on him personally
it is unrealistic to expect moral behavior in matters of public trust from someone who does not exhibit such behavior in his personal life weyrich said
private morals have public effects
tower  and twicedivorced served  years in the senate from texas including a tenure as chairman of the armed services committee from  to 
he has been dogged by reports that he is a harddrinker and a womanizer and that his hawkish views on defense do not square with the budgetary austerity that the pentagon faces
in announcing tower as his choice for the post on dec  president bush called the talk a lot of rumors that proved to be groundless
saying that nixon went to china bush added that towers record of support for pentagon spending hikes could be overturned
but weyrichs attack raised anew the issue of towers fitness for the job after two days of testimony last week in which tower won broad praise from committee members
ties to contractors fulbright institute scholar william c jackson jr and william g phillips president of the washingtonbased national council for industrial defense joined weyrich tuesday in opposing towers nomination
phillips echoed jacksons complaint that towers lucrative ties to defense contractors and past support for big defense budgets raise serious doubts that john tower is the best man for the job 
at this time in our history
a leading committee democrat acknowledged this point
wondered why the president of the united states chose john tower for this job given the emphasis that he has placed on ethics and the appearance of wrongdoing said nebraska sen james j exon
but the facts of the matter are that he has
sen john w warner rva in clarifying the grounds on which senate committees may assess presidential nominees told witnesses that it is not a function of the senate to say that this individual this nominee is the best man qualified
weyrich also told the committee that president bushs transition team received hundreds of letters opposing towers nomination some of which contain specific allegations of moral impropriety on the part of mr
tower
in a closed session of the committee weyrich was unable to add to his own observations with more than hearsay according to sen malcolm wallop rwyo
weyrich also acknowledged that he had no personal knowledge of the existence or content of the letters
but the allegation reviewed in advance by the committee prompted nunn and warner the panels ranking minority member to write white house counsel c boyden gray asking whether the allegations were investigated by the fbi and addressed in the bureaus report to the committee
wallop a tower supporter and a leading senate conservative termed it troublesome that innuendoes have been made the insinuations are on the table but the cameras do not record the fact that they are unsustainable
in open testimony weyrich also reflected widespread concerns among conservative activists that tower is not committed to the pentagons star wars missile defense program
he considers sdi the strategic defense initiative a bargaining chip weyrich said
we dont
the panel hopes to complete its deliberations by the end of this week nunn said and expects to meet once more today to consider towers nomination
defense secretarydesignate john tower contradicted an earlier sworn statement when he told the senate his work for a british firm involved no military matters according to reports published saturday
meanwhile new questions were raised about the thoroughness of the fbis background investigation of the embattled nominee
one newspaper reported that several bizarre accidents including earlymorning car crashes and a hotel fire apparently were overlooked in the probe
the senate armed services committee has put the nomination of tower a former texas senator and onetime chairman of the committee on hold while it takes a second look at towers personal habits including his use of alcohol and his links to defense contractors
tower who has declined to be interviewed while his nomination is pending has denied in his senate testimony any problem with alcohol or any conflicts of interest concerning his business ties
a white house spokesman stephen hart declined on saturday to comment on the latest reports saying its the nomination before the committee
towers designated spokesman attorney paul eggers of dallas did not answer a reporters calls saturday
in written testimony to the senate panel on jan  tower said he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities in connection with his work for the us subsidiary of british aerospace inc that statement according to two publications the los angeles times and the legal times did not square with information which tower provided to divorce attorneys working for his second wife in june of 
in the divorce deposition tower said he went to work for british aerospace eight weeks after resigning as the nations chief strategic arms negotiator and advised the company on how to sell training jets fighter planes and missile systems to the pentagon the los angeles times reported
tower told the senate committee he worked chiefly on selling commercial aircraft to us airlines and also advised the firm on trade legislation and currency fluctuations
he said he earned  from the company between june of  and last december
the legal times said tower told the divorce attorneys that he was retained by british aerospace for his advice on how to sell weapons systems to the pentagon and that he listed the various weapons involved
the deposition was never filed in court because tower did not contest the divorce but a copy was obtained by the fbi the legal times said
it said its reporters were allowed by attorneys to read it with the understanding that it not be quoted directly
the new york post reported saturday that the fbi apparently has not bothered to talk to towers neighbors examine certain police records or investigate several car accidents involving tower
the post citing syndicated columnist cody shearer said the incidents included an earlymorning episode on june   when tower was trapped in his hotel suite in dallas by a blaze he accidentally set by dropping a cigarette on an overstuffed armchair
when firemen broke into his room to remove him he was reportedly in no condition to free himself the post said
the newspaper also said tower wrecked his car in two earlymorning accidents within weeks of one another in  and two years earlier he drove into a bicycle ridden by james patrick montoya son of the late sen joseph montoya dnm on his way home from work
the youth was not seriously hurt
fbi spokesman bill carter refused comment on specifics of the tower investigation but said we will follow any lead
on friday tower authorized the release of a statement that recent hospital tests showed no evidence of alcohol abuse and vice president dan quayle said i have never seen drinking being a factor in john towers life other than a social glass of wine
eggers meanwhile acknowledged that there was no question that tower sometimes drank too much in the early s but he said he is not an alcoholic
hes not had a drinking problem for years

this years six nominees were chosen thursday from  books considered by a panel headed by david lodge a british literary critic and novelist who was nominated for the prize last year for his book nice work
gorbachev chose to ignore warnings about the rights impending attempt to seize power
some warnings came from gorbachevs liberal advisers such as alexander yakovlev shortly before the coup
but incredibly the clearest signals came from the hardliners themselves
 a leading conservative journalist alexander prokhanov known as the nightingale of the general staff published a transcript of his conversation with the head of the general staff academy the commanderinchief of the soviet navy and gorbachevs deputy at the defense council oleg baklanov
with remarkable candor baklanov called for a military takeover as an appropriate step to avert reforms that would result in a fundamental transformation of the union
needless to say baklanov delivered on that warning and joined the gang of eight
 gorbachev ignored these warnings
 to some  an admitted minority  the thought of a gorbachev conspiracy is comfortably within the range of the traditional soviet art of deception known as maskirovka
and to laymen something that odd could make sense in a country where illness can mean anything from the flu to a precipitous fall from power
 the most volatile fuel for the conspiracy theory came directly from gorbachev himself in his thursday news conference in which he described his three days under house arrest in the crimea
 among the questions if gorbachevs  armed guards remained loyal to him throughout why was there no conflict with the opposition delegation that notified the president of the coup
why didnt the coup leaders incapacitate gorbachevs guards or at least separate them from him
 if gorbachevs contact with the outside world was limited to intercepting western radio outlets on an ancient shortwave radio how was he able to describe the news conference given by the collaborators down to his view of their trembling hands
 it is highly unlikely that the hardliners had been set up or ordered by gorbachev to launch a hopeless coup attempt in order to improve his political standing
such a scenario would require an unprecedented degree of selfless commitment to gorbachev on their part
 a more plausible scenario is that gorbachev was initially a full member of the conspiracy which with his participation could have clung to the fig leaf of constitutionality and would have thwarted the new union treaty to have been signed last tuesday which provided for transfer of key levers of power from the federal presidency to the leaders of republics
 it is possible that unwilling to take a huge risk and openly side with the hardliners at the start of the coup gorbachev had decided to become ill and wait out the initial phase under virtually selfimposed confinement in his summer residence
 gorbachev did reveal however that two important officials had visited him in crimea at the outset of the coup
one was head of the kgb department responsible for the security of soviet leaders the other was v boldin gorbachevs closest aide by the presidents own admission a man of absolute loyalty to him
one cant help but wonder whether these two visitors came to deliver an ultimatum to gorbachev and put him under arrest in the event of his noncompliance or to deliver important documents from fellow junta members at the outset of their joint enterprise
 conspiracy theorists grope for motives  gorbachev wanted to ferret out disloyal elements in his government to make himself a hero and to delay the scheduled signing of a treaty that would have lessened his powers
but there is virtually unanimous agreement on one point
gorbachev put into power the very hardliners who fronted the coup and kept them in power despite their vocal mutterings about him
damage from hurricane hugo which stormed through the carolinas and the caribbean last week will reduce thirdquarter earnings for several insurers
new yorkbased american international group inc expects net losses related to hugo to reduce pretax earnings between  million and  million
analysts said aig has told them that it must cover the first  million of losses and that its reinsurance agreements will cover the bulk of the remaining damages
aig insured property in puerto rico the eastern caribbean islands and the coastal regions of the carolinas
st paul cos based in st paul minn said the pretax cost of hugo shouldnt exceed  million
that amount takes into consideration what st paul expects to recover under its reinsurance contracts the company said
philadelphiabased cigna corp is expected to disclose hugos likely impact on its earnings sometime today
udayan ghose an insurance industry analyst at shearson lehman hutton in new york estimates that cignas thirdquarter pershare earnings could be reduced by between  cents and  cents a share on an aftertax basis
that would wipe out  to  of his ashare earnings estimate for the third quarter
state farm mutual automobile insurance co said its state fire  casualty co unit estimates claim payments from hugo will exceed  million in south carolina alone far surpassing the companys record payout for a single disaster
when damages in north carolina and virginia are added the company said the payments will exceed  million
it said that is more than three times the previous record of  million set by hurricane alicia which hit the houstongalveston texas area in 
prime minister benazir bhutto on thursday accused india of waging genocide in secessionminded kashmir and of trying to start a war with pakistan to deflect attention
her remarks raised tensions further between india and pakistan which have been feuding over indiancontrolled kashmir
the two countries which have fought wars over the area in  and  have in recent weeks again built up their military forces near the common border
india is indulging in genocide ms bhutto said at a news conference thursday after returning from a weeklong tour of eight moslem countries in the middle east and north africa
islamic scholars are being killed and innocent people are being slaughtered
this is deplorable said the prime minister
she was referring to the assassination of maulvi mohammad farooq the top moslem cleric in indian kashmir
during his funeral procession monday indian forces shot to death  people
ms bhutto returned late wednesday from visits to iran turkey syria jordan north yemen egypt libya and tunisia a highprofile diplomatic offensive to drum up support for pakistans stand on the kashmir issue
hindudominated india accuses pakistan of arming and training kashmiri militants fighting for secession of jammukashmir indias only state with a moslem majority
pakistan which is dominated by moslems denies the indian charge
since the indian government ordered a crackdown on the militants in late january more than  people have been killed
during her trip abroad ms bhutto said all her host countries agreed that india and pakistan needed to find a lasting political settlement of the yearold dispute
however she added if subjected to aggression we would have the full support of the arab islamic nations
pakistan i was assured would never be left alone
we believe the threats to peace are grave she said
we cannot rule out the possibility of an armed conflict but we do not believe war is inevitable she told reporters
ms bhutto said she opposes an independent kashmir
she said it was not envisioned when india and pakistan gained independence in a  partition
the prime minister again called for talks between pakistan and india
she also said a neutral body should look into the charges made by both sides
india has already rejected both suggestions
as soon as the hardliners made their move sunday night  two days before gorbachev was to sign the treaty  it was obvious the coup was doomed to failure they said
 one result of the bungled coup is that soviet president mikhail gorbachev  even though reinstated as head of state  could be irrelevant to what happens next analysts said
even before gorbachev returned to moscow they predicted his future would be limited to a figurehead role
 he lost by being peripheral to what happened
no one really came to gorbachevs assistance as leader of the country one us official said
instead opposition to the coup was based on the illegality of the principle of usurping power and widespread fear that if gorbachev could be rolled up then other democratically elected leaders could be too
 in the aftermath of the coup analysts also predicted that check major constraints on soviet cooperation with the west such as the militarys disaffection with gorbachevs support of bushs strategy during the persian gulf war will now be greatly weakened or removed although a benign soviet union cannot be assumed in every case
 check the coups abrupt end opened the way for faster democratic reforms but it will not now create jeffersonian democracy  or maybe ever
 check the communist party is dead and will no longer be a political force although most of the countrys bureaucrats are current or former party members
 check gorbachev is likely to abandon the party and move more aggressively toward reform
documents which show for the first time that both mr robert maxwell and his son kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in maxwell communication corporation one of their own public companies have been obtained by the financial times
meanwhile a director of a secretive swiss trust mr werner rechsteiner has broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of mcc shares to his trust which are at the centre of an investigation by the serious fraud office were made on the instructions of robert maxwell
this is the first time that mr rechsteiner has given details of the relationship between his mysterious trust yakosa finanzierungs and the maxwell family
the ft has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which shows that mr kevin maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of m shares by yakosa and a further m shares by servex another swiss trust
the mcc purchases by yakosa and servex are the object of an investigation by the sfo into an alleged illegal scheme to support the mcc share price
the sfo is also investigating whether mr robert maxwell or mr kevin maxwell breached the companies act by failing to disclose the purchases of the shares by the swiss trusts
if either had a financial interest in the swiss trusts the purchases should have been disclosed under company law because they were both directors of mcc
the documents demonstrate that bishopsgate investment trust a private uk company controlled by the maxwell family provided pounds m on behalf of the two swiss trusts so that they could pay for the mcc shares
goldman sachs the us investment bank acted as broker to the deals
goldmans lawyers are convinced that it acted properly
mr rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since robert maxwells death in november on the subject of his relationship with the maxwell family
he said mcc share purchases had been going on for some time through yakosa
he denied that the shares were bought for yakosas own account
he said the shares were bought for other foundations and then held for a certain time
he also stressed that ownership of the mcc shares no longer rested with robert maxwell once they had been received by yakosa yakosa is owned by the maxwell foundation he said
mr rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the maxwell foundation which is based in liechtenstein but said it was neither robert nor kevin maxwell
the ft has however obtained documents showing that mr kevin maxwell was closely involved in the process of paying for m mcc shares on behalf of two swiss trusts yakosa and servex
on may  last year mr kevin maxwell sent a fax to mr larry wood an executive director of goldman sachs telling him that two parcels of m mcc shares each would be bought by the swiss trusts with pounds m provided by bit a maxwell private company
the fax signed by mr maxwell said that the funds would be remitted to goldman sachs by bishopsgate investment trust plc from its account at national westminter bank plc  lothbury
two other faxes sent by mr kevin maxwell to mr wood on the same day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the transaction the sale of the m shares
the swiss trusts bought the shares using goldman as broker from two maxwell pension funds maxwell communication pension trustee works scheme and mirror group newspaper pension trustee works scheme
each pension fund sold m shares at a price of p a share or pounds m in total
at pm on may  mr maxwell sent the two other faxes to mr wood on behalf of the two pension funds
as a director of mgpt and as a trustee of mccpt he told mr wood to pay each pension fund what it was owed to the natwest account of bit which mr maxwell described as nominee for the two pension funds
in other words he told mr wood that the shares were being bought for the swiss trusts with funds provided by bit and that these funds should then be sent by goldman back to bit
in the event on may  goldman received the pounds m by wire transfer in its account at barclays
goldman then levied its commission and expenses on the deal of pounds  and wired the remainder back to bits natwest account

ousted east german leader erich honecker will not stand trial in east germany as long as the formerly communist country exists a west german newspaper reported
the hamburgbased bild am sonntag said saturday that it would report in its sunday editions that honecker could be prosecuted in a united germany however for violation of property laws
bild quoted guenter seidel an east german prosecutor as saying that honecker had used  million for stocking a private housing estate for leaders of the former communist government
however seidel said that the investigation was not far enough along to determine whether charges could be filed against honecker before east germany merges with west germany on oct 
negotiators are still working out the merger of the two german legal systems
honecker  was ousted as east germanys leader on oct  paving the way for the countrys first freely elected government in march
honecker is in poor health and remains confined to a soviet military hospital in beelitz outside east berlin
he is under investigation on allegations of abuse of power corruption harboring terrorists and issuing shoottokill orders to prevent east germans from escaping to west germany when he served as the countrys leader
bild said that erich mielke the exhead of east germanys former secret police was also unlikely to go to court in east germany
i am at the end
i am a dead man bild quoted mielke  as saying at his last interrogation
the government on thursday allowed for the possibility of a reunified germany but said such a state must be formed gradually and respect polands borders
in the solidarity governments first definitive statement on the issue foreign minister krzysztof skubiszewski told parliament the two german states could be joined as part of the process of uniting europe
he said german reunification cannot go ahead of the reunification of europe
a reunited germany will not be created tomorrow or the day after tomorrow skubiszewski said
fears and concerns appearing every now and then including in poland are unjustified although alertness is recommended
asked about german reunification at a news conference in gdansk solidarity labor leader lech walesa said he prefers no political changes in europe but there should be all kinds of economic integrations
western european countries have agreed to form an economic union by the end of 
sweeping democratic reforms have taken hold in east germany in the past several weeks under the pressure of mass protests spurring talk of reuniting the two german states divided at the end of world war ii
west germany has proposed a plan for greater unity but east german leaders reject reunification
the specter of a powerful reunited germany has troubed many poles especially the older ones who recall the  nazi invasion of poland that began world war ii
a reported surge in antipolish sentiment in east germany in recent weeks has heightened polish anxieties
skubiszewskis speech seemed designed to reassure poles that the government does not see unification in the near future and will insist on polands current borders
skubiszewski faulted west german chancellor helmut kohls program for gradual german reunification offered last week for not making clear that reunification would respect the existing border between poland and east germany
some rightwing west german politicians have called for recovering the  square miles of territory that germany lost to poland at the end of world war ii
the territory is about onethird of presentday poland
east germany and west germany each separately has recognized the border but there has been no official assurance that a reunified germany would also acknowledge the border
one can only unite within established borders and without territorial arguments said skubiszewski
he also said german reunification is unlikely as long as west germany belongs to nato and east germany to the sovietled warsaw pact military alliance
president bush has named career diplomat deane hinton as ambassador to panama the white house announced tuesday
hinton currently ambassador to costa rica replaces ambassador arthur h davis who was recalled by bush in protest of what the administration considered the stealing of the panamanian elections last may by gen manuel antonio noriega
bush sent davis back to panama city after the dec  invasion of panama by us forces and installation of guillermo endara as president
independent observers mostly concluded endara had won the elections by a hefty margin
bush named hinton as a recess appointment because congress is not in session
that means hinton can serve until the end of next year before he must go before the senate for confirmation
the appointment of the yearold hinton with his long expierience on latin american issues is seen as a signal of the importance bush is placing on restoring normal relations with panama
those relations steadily deteriorated after the united states indicted noriega once a ally particularly of the us intelligence community on drug trafficking charges in florida
hinton has been ambassador to costa rica since 
before that he was ambassador to pakistan from  to  and ambassador to el salvador from  to 
he was assistant secretary of state for economic and business affairs from  to  and before that us representative to the nation european community headquartered in brussels a state department adviser on economic affairs and director and economic counselor of the state departments agency for economic development in chile and in guatemala
davis a former state department consultant and former ambassador to paraguay was sent to panama by president reagan in 
bush wanted to name his own ambassador and the time was appropriate with the installation of a new government in panama said one administration official
officials described hinton as an experienced latin america hand and a good person to have in place with the volatile developments in the south american country
on capitol hill senate majority leader george mitchell dmaine called hinton highly qualified for the post because of his wideranging experience and expertise in central america
however mitchell said he hoped bush would send the appointment to the senate after congress convenes jan  despite the nature of the recess appointment

a row has erupted between the bombay stock exchange indias largest stock market and the securities and exchange board of india the securities watchdog over the boards recent firstever inspection of stockbrokers books
the sebi has accused stockbrokers of flouting the exchanges rules including regulations on margin trading designed to limit the risk of members defaulting through excessive speculative investments
it has also accused the exchange authorities of failing to enforce rules and of poor administration
the stock exchange denied the allegations saying they were baseless made out of context and blown out of proportion

mr m r mayya the bses executive director said bse rules permitted such bilateral offexchange transactions
sebi also accused the exchange of mismanaging the administration of its building
this weeks argument is only the latest in a series of disputes which began almost as soon as sebi started operations a year ago
it was established by mr manmohan singh the finance minister as a crucial element in financial reform
brokers claim the sebi is heavyhanded and fails to understand their needs
they say rules must be applied flexibly and many firms are extremely small and unable to carry the cost of extra regulations
but the finance minister is backing sebi to the hilt and singled it out for praise in his recent budget speech
finance ministry officials believe loose regulations allow brokers and others to dodge taxes and also contributed to last years securities market scandal in which banks including the uks standard chartered bank lost a combined gross total of rsbn
yeltsin the triumphant leader of the resistance against this weeks military coup has drastically tipped the balance of power here showing himself to be at least the political equal if not the master of gorbachev
in a symbol of the new order the russian tricolor the banner of the anticoup resistance flew over the gates of the kremlin alongside the red soviet flag for the first time since the rise of the bolshevik state
 in a joint appearance with gorbachev in the russian parliament broadcast live on soviet television yeltsin made it clear that the soviet president can maintain a semblance of authority only if he agrees to share power and intensify the march toward a democratic political system and a market economy
 and now for a bit of relaxation yeltsin said interrupting gorbachevs speech
let me sign a decree suspending the activity of the russian communist party
 gorbachev who has insisted the party is still capable of reform stammered a bit and then said boris nikolayevich boris nikolayevich 
with an expression that was halfsmile halfsneer yeltsin broke in
its been signed he said definitively and the deputies broke out in cheering and applause
gorbachev struggled to explain his own position but he seemed at a loss
 yeltsin who clearly relished his emotional and political control of the parliament session also played a critical role in selecting the new heads of the kgb the defense ministry and the interior ministry police which until now have been bastions of opposition to reform
flouting protocol yeltsin was the first to announce the appointments while speaking at a mass rally friday morning outside kgb headquarters
 new appointees former interior minister vadim bakatin will head the kgb gen yevgeny shaposhnikov the air force chief becomes defense minister and former russian interior minister victor barannikov will be the unions interior minister
all three men took a clear stand against the coup and are expected to move quickly to reform the key institutions they now head
 gorbachev also fired alexander bessmertnykh as foreign minister
although bessmertnykh said he had refused to go along with the coup leaders gorbachev said he had information that his top diplomat had been maneuvering or at least did not take a firm stand
 bessmertnykh reacted with bitterness according to the tass news agency and claimed that he had refused to join the conservative uprising even though coup leader and former kgb chief vladimir kryuchkov had told him we need a liberal among us
 in both moscow and leningrad city officials ordered police to seal off communist party headquarters
moscow mayor gavril popov said investigators had to make a thorough search of party buildings and documents to determine the scope of the coup and its participants
across the country communist party leaders who opposed the coup quit their party posts and some who supported it such as latvian party leader alfred rubiks were arrested
 the leader of the russian orthodox church patriarch alexei ii said the coup meant the end of communist ideology in the country
god has saved russia he declared
 as gorbachev struggled during the minute session of the russian parliament he called for maturity and balance in judging the conspirators and said lets not have a witch hunt
 greeted by protesters from the moment that protesters outside the russian parliament building greeted the arrival of gorbachevs limousine with shouts of resign
resign
it was clear that the soviet president was not about to get a warm homecoming from those who played a key role in rescuing him
 the russian deputies  and yeltsin especially  were alternately sarcastic and aggressive
when gorbachev had trouble at one point explaining one development in the coup yeltsin broke in like an exasperated schoolmaster
sometimes mikhail sergeyevich forgets things he said
 yeltsin also seemed eager to impress on gorbachev just how thoroughly he had been betrayed by his own ministers and presumed allies
he handed gorbachev the minutes of a closed council of ministers meeting held last monday during which all of the more than  ministers present  with one or two exceptions  supported the coup and the state committee for the state of emergency set up by the putsch leaders
 i havent read this yet said gorbachev in an attempt to put off the matter
 go ahead yeltsin insisted
read it now
 and gorbachev did reeling off the names of all of the ministers who had for so long mouthed the slogans of reform and then stabbed him in the back
 this whole government has got to resign gorbachev said with a degree of despair in his voice
i must say this has been a great drama for me a severe trial
 retribution for yeltsin yeltsin seemed to take extraordinary relish in this shakespearean drama of betrayal and retribution
it had been gorbachev who ordered yeltsin out of a hospital bed in  to face a vengeful meeting of the moscow communist party committee
at that session one speaker after another attacked yeltsin for political immaturity and other sins for daring to criticize the party and its politburo
 and it was gorbachev in  who came to the russian parliament to call on deputies to vote against yeltsin as their chairman
although this seemingly endless political saga of two reformers who can only struggle to find a common language seemed at an end this spring when they began negotiations on a new union treaty it is clear that their relationship will likely remain the great floating opera of soviet politics
 gorbachev said he and yeltsin had also agreed to assume each others duties in an emergency
 if one or another gets in the situation when he cannot even give orders like what happened now his rights and responsibilities are automatically taken by the other gorbachev said
 it appeared that the move would have to be temporary and could be made permanent only with legislative consent
soviet law makes the vice president the nextinline
gennady yanayev invoked that law in the coup while declaring gorbachev physically incapacitated
 the conspirators themselves are now in jail and facing interrogation
gorbachev said the leaders of the junta tried to turn us all into chopped meat and they should be prosecuted without hesitation or forgiveness
 soviet prime minister valetin pavlov has been arrested for helping to lead the coup soviet and russian television reported today
 pavlov was one of the eight officials in the committee that ousted gorbachev from power but he was reportedly taken ill on sunday night when the coup began
 he has been under police guard in a hospital since gorbachev regained power wednesday
 speculation of guilt also turned on another key figure in the old gorbachev government
according to yeltsin supreme soviet chairman anatoly lukyanov has been ousted for taking part in the coup but that has not been confirmed

the store manager of the walmart in this community on the outskirts of dallas tells a story that gives an insight into the man considered responsible for a retailing phenomenon
manager don bost remembers one day last summer when a secretary telephoned from walmart stores incs corporate headquarters in bentonville ark
chairman sam walton was about to land at a nearby airport and the secretary asked if someone could fetch him and bring him to the de soto store
paying unexpected calls on stores is one way walton has kept in close touch with everyday goingson
his example is followed by other walmart executives and most make a point of spending a lot of time in the field
says ed nagy district manager for  stores in the dallas metropolitan area its not like uhoh someones coming because theyre always out
by all accounts sam waltons personality permeates operations throughout the company
everyone from walmart president and chief operating officer david glass down to an hourly store worker can readily quote the gospel according to sam as he is called
to paraphrase sams primary rules of retailing rule no is the customer is always right
rule no says just in case the customers wrong revert to rule no
if the principles sound oldfashioned and homespun they are because thats the way sam is people who know him say
he shuns the limelight that his companys success has shed on him and has decided to refuse almost all press requests for interviews
hes happy to chat with folks in his stores though
he also regularly reminds walmart associates that hospitality to customers is crucial
he preaches it in person or via hightech satellite hookup with his stores
walmart employees became known as associates under a company effort to prove it cared about employees partly to thwart a union organizing effort in the late s
one of the most sensitive subjects for walton is the fortune hes amassed
a close associate says sam would probably give anything not to be named on fortune magazines list of the countrys wealthiest people
the magazine has estimated that his immediate familys stake in walmart stock is worth about  billion
sam walton is more interested in his backhand than he is in his bank account says don shinkle walmart spokesman
samuel moore walton turns  on march 
he was born in kingfisher okla and grew up as the son of a farmmortgage banker
he graduated from the university of missouri with an economics degree in  and joined jc penney co as a management trainee in des moines iowa
after serving three years in the army he went to arkansas and opened a ben franklin fiveanddime store eventually becoming the companys biggest franchisee
the seeds of the walmart empire were sown when sam and his brother james l or bud opened the first walmart discount city in 
the rest will probably earn an entry in the history of us retail trade
bud is a senior vice president and board member of walmart
three of the four grown children sam and his wife helen had are involved with the company in various capacities
sam hasnt slowed much enjoying hunting and tennis as much as ever and is said not to suffer after effects from a bout with leukemia now in remission
he spends less time in the office since handing over most responsiblities to david glass
sam is still chairman of the board
glass doesnt hesitate when asked if walmart can flourish without sam
the answer is an emphatic yes because he says we have great people
the walton family will always be involved he adds
commenting on the future glass says well be judged on what we produce today
tomorrow what weve done in the past wont matter

gorbachev threw out his foreign minister alexander bessmertnykh and his acting defense minister and named a new head of the kgb
and yeltsin with gorbachevs blessing fired the heads of stateowned media
 the moscow city council meanwhile ordered all communist party buildings in the capital sealed and all telephone service to party and kgb buildings cut
about  protesters blockaded the communist party headquarters in moscow declaring they were trying to prevent the removal of documents that might contain evidence linking party members to the coup
some of the demonstrators chanted down with the communist party
 yeltsin who had led the nationwide resistance to the coup announced a ban on communist party activities in the russian republic the army police units of the interior ministry and the kgb which for decades helped enforce communist rule
some of the many new decrees issued by yeltsin went beyond the official bounds of his power as russian federation president
 in his speech before the russian parliament gorbachev was compelled to affirm as legitimate the decrees issued by yeltsin during the threeday coup
it wasnt clear whether the soviet president had intended to back yeltsins latest decrees and he balked at proposals by russian deputies to outlaw the communist party saying it would divide the nation
 gorbachev told the deputies that the government would prosecute those responsible for the takeover
they wanted to turn us into meat
they wanted to annihilate us and for that they must bear the severe responsibility the soviet president said
 he accused the communist party central committee of panicking during the coup
there are people who lost their heads all sense of responsibility
you could even call them traitors
traitors
 at one point during the session gorbachev dramatically held up what he said were the minutes of a secret cabinet meeting during the coup that revealed who backed the emergency decrees
he said many of them hemmed and hawed but most voted in support of the takeover
 todays meeting displayed unprecedented openness in which deputies repeatedly interrupted gorbachev and argued with him
 gorbachev drew applause from deputies when he announced that the partys headquarters in moscow was sealed
 the meeting of gorbachev and yeltsin was the first since the coup collapsed to discuss the takeover and to deal with officials who backed the putsch
 in his speech gorbachev praised the outstanding role of yeltsin his sometimes adversary in halting the hardline communist coup
yeltsin has been a strong foe of communist party influence in the country gorbachev however warned in his speech against any kind of anticommunist hysteria
 yeltsin often commented during gorbachevs speech and gorbachev deferred to him several times on details of what happened during gorbachevs detention
 standing ovation the soviet presidents opening comments drew a standing ovation from the lawmakers in the parliament
yeltsin led the opposition to the coup from the parliament building where supporters rallied to build barricades and form a human shield against expected attacks
the coup plotters never dared mount a frontal assault on yeltsins headquarters during the standoff
 as the face of the soviet government continued to change in the aftermath of the failed coup hundreds of angry residents marched toward communist party headquarters in moscow intent on proving the party was behind the coup
 in other developments check only one of the eight top leaders of the coup remained at large early today  oleg baklanov deputy of the state defense committee
 check in kirghizia kirghiz president askar akaev said the republic would take control of the headquarters of the kirghiz wing of the communist party as well as the local lenin museum
akaev said the party would be compensated
 publication suspended in moscow yeltsin today nationalized the hundreds of printing plants in the russian republic
 he suspended the publication of six communist party newspapers and ordered new chiefs for the official novosti and tass news services charging they had supported the takeover
 the actions by yeltsin who quit the party last summer came amid a growing wave of anger at the communist party six of whose top party officials were arrested for instigating the coup
 in a major blow to the crumbling party the acting head of the kgb today affirmed yeltsins ban on communist party activity in the security service tass said
a kgb directive also banned any other political parties in the kgb for decades used by communist regimes to intimidate dissidents and anticommunist activists
 bold protests the firing of bessmertnykh followed criticism of his silence during the coup
bessmertnykh  was the latest official to step down or be removed after the failed takeover
he was not seen publicly after the coup began and he didnt reemerge until the coup leadership began to collapse
bessmertnykh said he had been ill and unable to act
 the arrest of the former kgb chief and other communist party hardliners inspired tens of thousands of demonstrators to undreamedof daring thursday
 they expressed their anger and disgust with the organizations responsible for killing millions of soviet citizens and now caught conspiring to return to their old dictatorship
 at kgb headquarters on dzerzhinsky street thousands shook fists and shouted executioners
they smeared down with the kgb
and a swastika on the front of the building in white paint

geraldo rivera was interviewing peggy ann buckey on tv
abby mann watched listened  and saw the makings of a movie
prosecutors had just dropped charges of child molestation against buckey one of the original seven defendants in the mcmartin preschool case
in that  interview peggy buckey was quite eloquent in arguing that charges against her brother ray and mother peggy mcmartin buckey should be dropped as well mann recalled friday
mann an oscar and emmywinning screenwriter and producer recognized a theme he had tapped before the hysteria of a witch hunt
soon mann became a controversial figure in the case itself  but he got the inside track on movie and book deals
and thursdays notguilty verdicts in ray and peggy mcmartin buckeys trial gave mann the happy ending he was hoping for  happy at least from his point of view
but mann and his wife myra who have an page manuscript in the works for random house and say they are close to finishing a screenplay arent expected to monopolize the telling of the yearold mcmartin case  or the perspective
at least two other books are planned and at least one prominent television movie producer besides mann says he is developing a mcmartin project
that producer who requested anonymity said he is certain other producers are considering projects as well
its definitely a tv thing one agent said
just one of those perfect highconcept lurid television mows  an acronym for moviesoftheweek
the producer chases down participants gets rights  and then its an easy sale to networks
not that easy network executives say
unlike the hottest truelife property of the moment  the stuart murder case in boston which has cbs and the fries co racing to produce the first docudrama  mcmartin creates some tricky legal and moral problems
the jurys deadlock on  counts creates an ambiguity is ray buckey a villain or a victim
none of the three networks would touch ray buckeys story predicted steven white an independent producer who used to be a movie executive for both nbc and abc
first the man is still accused of  crimes
if i were sitting in my old job i wouldnt touch this thing with a foot pole
it raises so many legal and ethical questions at this point it would have to be looked at with a microscope said larry strichman a senior executive in movie development at cbs
what is the story you want to tell
is it a story of justice done or justice denied
and its real unclear at the moment what the answer to that question is
unlike a documentary its hard to take an ambiguous position in a docudrama
producers think network qualms can be overcome however
one pointed out that the billionaire boys club docudrama was broadcast before all the trials regarding the slayings were over
there are no rules the producer said
hollywoods role in the mcmartin case came to prominence early
not long after the first allegations of child molestation six years ago several producers pitched projects to networks
though no explicit mcmartin story was produced child abuse and molestation was a recurring subject
one cbs fictional movie last year  did you know the muffin man
 featured a preschool and satanic child molesters
mann whose writing credits include the academy awardwinning judgment at nuremberg in  won an emmy for the marcusnelson murders a threehour kojak drama based on a true case in which a black youth was wrongly convicted of the killings of two white women
the prosecutors the media and the community seemed blinded by hysteria mann said
gaining the confidence of the mcmartin defendants the manns were ultimately hired as investigators by the defense
that and their earlier alliance with former prosecutor glenn stevens sparked charges from parents of alleged child molestation victims of a conspiracy to obstruct justice for monetary gain
stevens who said he had asked to be removed from the mcmartin trial team in october  said he and mann agreed in march  to produce a book and movie about the case with the understanding that their discussions would become public after the trial and appeals were over
but in late  mann released interviews with stevens in which stevens said he doubted the defendants guilt
mann said his attorneys had advised him that to withhold them would be an obstruction of justice
outraged parents suggested the real aim was a notguilty verdict which would improve the value of manns movie deal
but stevens and the manns have said their ambition from the start has been to get the truth out
at least two other perspectives may reach the bookstores
ray buckeys lawyer danny davis and writer gordon dillow former columnist for the defunct los angeles herald examiner have a book proposal that is being pitched to a variety of publishers
times staff writer lois timnick who covered the case from its early stages through the trial also is planning a book
mann said his script isnt a courtroom drama
its not a trial movie
its what happens to human beings
i intend to be fair to the parents
i dont mean to be vindicative
for the most part i have great sympathy for the parents
after hours of heated deliberation  under a system described as mad by one judge  the pounds  booker prize for fiction last night went to mr james kelman for how late it was how late published by secker and warburg
the novel a story of scottish lowlife narrated largely in glaswegian dialect is unlikely to prove a popular choice with booksellers who have damned all six books shortlisted for the prize as boring elitist and  worst of all  unsaleable
professor john bayley chairman of the booker judges acknowledged that mr kelmans book in particular might be deemed inaccessible
we had an extremely difficult final meeting and were very divided he said after three hours of debate
rabbi julia neuberger the only woman on the judging panel said she was made extremely cross by the decision
its just a drunken scotsman railing against bureaucracy she said
my eyes are stretched in disbelief
the voting system is completely mad
kelman was the least favourite of the three front runners
if it had been a short story it would have been fine
mr kelmans book is according to some observers the most difficult work to have won the prize
in his acceptance speech mr kelman perceived by some as a scottish isolationist anticipated the criticism by declaring my culture and my language have the right to exist
one guest at the prizegiving dinner at londons guildhall mr salman rushdie who won the prize in  with midnights children remarked james kelman is good but not as good as he thinks he is
the booker prize has in its year history always provoked controversy
but this years rows have been of a particularly fine vintage
prof bayley went on record with a rousing condemnation of contemporary fiction
another judge mr james wood literary critic of the guardian was attacked for failing to reveal that a young novelist being considered for the award ms claire messud was in fact mrs james wood
most damaging of all was the verdict of the booksellers who dismissed the shortlist as narcoleptic
the other contenders were the folding star by alan hollinghurst beside the ocean of time by george mackay brown paradise by abdulrazak gurnah reef by romesh gunesekera and knowledge of angels by jill paton walsh
in spite of heavy publicity the novels nominated have been selling  per cent less than last years shortlist
last years winner roddy doyles paddy clarke ha ha ha sold  copies
kelmans novel is unlikely to come anywhere near that one bookseller said
mr kelman was also shortlisted for the prize in  for his novel a disaffection
hurricane gilbert weakened to a tropical storm as it blustered northwestward today but it threw tornadoes and sheets of rain at thousands of shuttered evacuees along the texasmexico border
at least  people have been killed and more than  left homeless since gilbert ripped through the caribbean with  mph wind earlier this week then crossed the yucatan peninsula and gulf of mexico before slamming into northeastern mexico
one person died today in texas after being injured in a tornado
but by this morning the once massive storms maximum sustained winds had flagged to  mph nine less than hurricane strength and forecasters said the eye had all but disappeared
however they warned of continued danger from flash flooding inland
gilbert was downgraded to a tropical storm at  am edt as it proceeded  miles southeast of the city of monterrey in northern mexico said noel rishnychok a meteorologist with the national hurricane center in coral gables fla
winds were still weakening as the storm moved westnorthwest at  mph he said
gulf coast residents expressed relief that the storm which earlier was deemed the most powerful ever tracked in the western hemisphere pulled its punch as it came ashore despite delivering a spate of tornadoes
were thankful said betty turner mayor of corpus christi
what could have been one of the most deadly storms in history appears to have missed us
corpus christi residents who evacuated were eager to return but turner said were saying dont do it because of the flooding

gilberts remnants should bring very heavy rains to rio grande valley before heading north up the mississippi river valley as a huge rainmaking machine said mark zimmer meteorologist at the national hurricane center in coral gables fla the danger of flash flooding in texas is very great zimmer said
rainfall as high as  to  inches  maybe even  inches  is expected
by midweek the storm should be in the lower ohio river valley and end up in the great lakes as nothing more than foul weather forecasters said
the people in the midwest better dust off their umbrellas zimmer said
gilbert responsible for billions of dollars in damage during a weeklong rampage across the caribbean and gulf of mexico barreled ashore friday afternoon in tamaulipas state a sparsely populated area of mexico about  miles south of brownsville
the eye passed over santa rosa and santa cruz two small villages a few miles north of la pesca mexico where ocean tides coursed over two miles of flatlands and into the town
we presume the mexican villages are getting a good pounding from  mph winds zimmer said friday
thousands of people evacuated in areas of northeastern mexico including the entire beach area of matamoros a city of  just across the border

were going home
we think everything is going to be ok philip gibbons said friday night leaving a brownsville shelter into a downpour
we dont think its going to get bad and there was no need to stay here anymore
others however were more cautious
i wouldnt want to go home and then have my family hurt by a tornado said praxedis lindsey  of brownsville who was at a shelter with his pregnant wife and son
elsewhere most of the estimated  people evacuated in southern louisiana and  in the island city of galveston were allowed to return home friday

one texas drowning was indirectly related to the hurricane
a yearold boy fell from his familys shrimp boat when they moved the vessel for safe mooring officials said
rains from hurricane gilbert sent a river raging over its banks in monterrey sweeping at least  policemen to their deaths and overturning buses loaded with evacuees from matamoros police said today
the flooding occurred in monterrey an industrial city of  million people located  miles from the texas border and  miles inland from matamoros
at least  police officers were swept away while on a rescue mission around midnight a judicial police officer said
several buses loaded with evacuees overturned in the raging water and more were feared drowned
the officer who spoke on condition of anonymity said early today it had been raining for more than  hours
a trailer truck also slid into the santa catarina river in the driving rain and its two occupants were missing the local newspaper el norte said

the storm slammed into mexico for the second time in a week friday afternoon
the eye of milewide hurricane with  mph winds crossed onto land at  pm edt sweeping ashore in a sparsely populated area  miles south of brownsville texas weather reports said
although the storm had lost much of its muscle it caused floods and mudslides after it barreled into mexico
earlier in the week gilbert killed at least  and left  people homeless in the yucatan peninsula
the hurricane has killed at least  people including one in texas  in mexico  in jamaica  in haiti five in the dominican republic and eight in honduras

the sierra de tamaulipas a small mountain range between monterrey and the coast should blunt the hurricanes strength said mark zimmer a meterologist at the national hurricane center
zimmer expected the last of hurricaneforce winds today
but he predicted very heavy rains as warm hurricane winds rise into cooler mountain air possibly causing flash floods and mudslides
the mexican armed forces began emergency flights friday of food medicines and water to cancun cozumel and other disaster sites in the yucatan
in many locations hurricane victims were without food drinking water electrical power gasoline and communications since wednesday
aspirin sales jumped  percent for a few weeks earlier this year not because of a rash of headaches
a study of more than  male doctors had shown that taking a single aspirin every other day could cut heart attack risk in half
the study was one of a series of recent reports showing for the first time that doctors are able not only to treat heart attacks  but also to prevent them
in the most recent report doctors found that one aspirin tablet and a single dose of a clotdissolving drug given within  hours can dramatically cut the risk of a second fatal heart attack
without the treatment patients had a  percent chance of dying from a second heart attack within five weeks the researchers found
with the treatment the figure dropped to  percent
the real discovery is that treatment for patients is going to reduce inhospital mortality substantially says richard peto of oxford university one of the studys authors
heart disease is the nations leading cause of death by far
the national center for health statistics reports that  americans died of heart disease in 
to put it another way of the  american who died that year more than one in three died of heart disease
this does not include those who died of bloodvessel diseases such as strokes
the drugs most responsible for the recent success in preventing heart attacks are the new clotdissolvers and that old standby aspirin
the usual cause of heart attacks is a blockage of the coronary arteries which supply the heart muscle with oxygenrich blood
the blockage arises from the buildup of fats cholesterol and clotted blood
clotdissolvers break up clots thus restoring blood flow
aspirin interferes with aspects of the clotting process helping to prevent clot formation in the first place
the limited sales of the clotdissolving drugs in the united states show that many doctors are still not using them despite their proven success
but that is beginning to change
some doctors predict that in the nottoodistant future these drugs will be judged so safe that they will be administered routinely by paramedics in ambulances before suspected heart attack victims even reach the hospital
we have to know how to respond quickly and we have to have the courage to use these drugs in the absence of definitive diagnosis says dr burton sobel of washington university in st louis a pioneer in the testing of the clotdissolvers
the most important thing we can do is teach patients in advance about the value of early treatment he says
while most public attention has focused on this new ability to prevent heart attacks researchers have also made important progress in speeding the recovery of patients who survive heart attacks
researchers at the university of michigan recently determined that some heart attack victims can be released from the hospital as soon as three days after their heart attacks
most heart attacks victims are kept in the hospital for at least seven to  days
the patients given early discharge were able to return to work two weeks sooner than others in the study group
after six months not one death was recorded in the earlydischarge group
the researchers concluded that perhaps  percent of heart attacks victims could be safely discharged after three days
in july stanford university doctors found that workers who went back to their jobs about seven weeks after their heart attacks did at least as well as workers who went back after a more typical convalescence of about  or  weeks
all of these advances come at a time when public health experts are increasingly emphasizing the role of good health and good nutrition in lowering heart disease risk
early next year the american heart association seal of approval will begin appearing on foods that are low in fat and cholesterol and therefore can help reduce heart disease risk
us
surgeon general c everett koop in july issued his first report on nutrition calling on americans to lower their consumption of fats and to eat more vegetables fruits fish poultry and whole grains
the report has been likened to the first surgeon generals report on smoking issued in  which focused public attention on smokings hazards
koops recommendations largely echo those of the american heart association but they should help carry the message to many more people
progress in research on heart disease is making clear that the heart attack is no longer a mysterious killer that strikes without warning and cannot be defended against
much can be done to prevent heart attacks great improvements are being made in treatments and recovery is faster than ever before
the use of a clotdissolver and aspirin could alone save  lives a year in the united states doctors say
these results says dr peter sleight of oxford university will change medical practice worldwide
general accident the leading british insurer said yesterday that insurance claims arising from hurricane andrew could cost it as much as dollars m
lord airlie the chairman who was addressing an extraordinary shareholders meeting said on the basis of emerging information general accident advise that the losses to their us operations arising from hurricane andrew which struck florida and louisiana might in total reach the level at which external catastrophe reinsurance covers would become exposed
what this means is that ga is able to pass on its losses to external reinsurers once a certain claims threshold has been breached
it believes this threshold may be breached in respect of hurricane andrew claims
however if this happens it would suffer a posttax loss of dollars m pounds m
mr nelson robertson gas chief general manager explained later that the company has a  per cent share of the florida market
it has a branch in orlando
the companys loss adjusters are in the area trying to estimate the losses
their guess is that losses to be faced by all insurers may total more than dollars bn
not all damaged property in the area is insured and there have been estimates that the storm caused more than dollars bn of damage
however other insurers have estimated that losses could be as low as dollars bn in total
mr robertson said no one knows at this time what the exact loss is
troops of the former soviet union were ordered to pull out from the armenian enclave of nagornokarabakh yesterday after they were fired on during clashes between azeri and armenian militants
marshal yevgeny shaposhnikov the commonwealth of independent states defence minister announced the decision as fighting worsened in the disputed territory in spite of efforts to secure a truce
the enclave is administered by azerbaijan but largely populated by armenians
the order for the pullout of the th motorised regiment follows the deaths earlier this week of a handful of soldiers caught in the fighting between armenian guerrillas and azerbaijani forces
fighting flared again yesterday in the capital stepanakert where the regiment is based
azerbaijani and armenian officials claimed their civilian targets were under particularly vicious attack
marshal shaposhnikov who is also commanderinchief has long warned that he would withdraw troops rather than allow them to become targets of ethnic conflicts in the former soviet union
no dates have been given for the withdrawal
troops under fire along the armenianazerbaijani border will also be withdrawn
commanders of the transcaucasus military district which encompasses georgia as well as armenia and azerbaijan have been ordered to rebuff attacks on military installations
azeri and armenian officials say sophisticated weapons including combat helicopters tanks and armoured personnel carriers are being used by guerrillas on both sides in the fouryearold conflict
armenian militants attacked the last azeri stronghold in nagornokarabakh yesterday according to azerbaijans interior ministry which said residents of the town of shusha fled as helicopter gunships swooped down from snowcovered mountains
armenians in the enclave want unification with armenia but azerbaijan will not give up any territory
when celebrity biographer albert goldman began digging into the lives of john lennon his first move was to mail a long reverential request for help to yoko ono
she was numero uno youve got to start with her
i sent her a sincere letter because at that time i was a true believer in rocks greatest love story
i told her im in your corner goldman recalled
ono never responded
and after  interviews and  years the dream was over for goldman his mythic view of lennon the great altered
expecting the best goldman claims to have uncovered the worst a volatile debauched lennon who evolved into the howard hughes of rock n roll tucked in his dakota bed for days at a time
that vision of the exbeatle has infuriated lennon supporters family and friends and prompted charges of fiction writing it also taught goldman  who says he is a john lennon fan  a hard lesson
it doesnt pay to meet your idols
just enjoy them dont try to see the reality goldman said
my books are a cold dose of reality
you get in the beatle shower and suddenly the water goes cold
goldman whose past tellall biographies dealt with elvis presley and lenny bruce remains unmoved by the hue and cry from the music industry from ono and from lennons beatle buddy paul mccartney
my books are bad for business goldman said in a phone interview from munich west germany
theyre bad for pauls business bad for yokos business back for the jive myth of rock business
those people have to hate me
mythshattering is a not a bad thing goldman said
for example he cites lennons disillusioning meeting with presley at graceland in 
john was very hooked into elvis
elvis was his measure of success said goldman
and the myth of elvis awesome
but the reality of elvis a mess
goldman also rejected the complaint raised by ono mccartney julian lennon and others that lennon is an easy target to defame because hes no longer around to answer the allegations
you cant say john lacks for defenders
and yoko isnt dead
colonel parker presleys manager isnt dead
ninetyfive percent of the people in my books arent dead
they can do something about it said goldman his voice quickening
this business of making it easy for defending myself is insane
im the target of scores of attacks
i cant imagine a harder thing for an author
those attacks dont really bother him unless they come from someone who hasnt read the lives of john lennon goldman said
a lot of people already made up their minds
they hear albert goldman john lennon homosexuality  bang let him have it
i resent people commenting on a book they havent read including yoko the author said
onos reaction came on a nationally broadcast response to the book
she labeled goldmans version of life with the lennons totally fiction and brought out lennons sons julian and yearold sean to refute the biography
these giant promotions of yoko are presented as honest documentaries when theyre inhouse documentaries said goldman who complimented ono on a wellprepared show
she takes no chances
this was another nochance yoko
as for the sensational charges of bisexuality drug abuse by yoko and john wild drinking binges anorexia and reclusiveness goldman says it all fits together with the image of lennon presented by those who knew him
my thesis is john lennon was a divided mind
every yin had a yang said goldman
there is nothing more natural than for john to try the other side sexually
thats just the kind of guy he was
he wanted to try everything once
the san francisco ers routed the denver broncos  sunday in the most lopsided super bowl victory ever
the ers win in the th super bowl made them the first repeat nfl champion in a decade and tied the pittsburgh steelers as a pinnacle of super bowl perfection with four wins in four tries
san francisco won the national football league championship game in   and 
the broncos on the other hand lost the last four super bowl games they have played
san francisco quarterback joe montana made five touchdown passes three to jerry rice breaking a super bowl record for touchdown passes on a day on which he also set a record with  straight pass completions
he also set five super bowl career records including his third super bowl most valuable player award and san franciscos point total was the most ever
montana left the game with nearly  minutes to play
in four super bowls he has thrown  touchdowns and no interceptions

san francisco was boringly perfect doing more than even the experts who made them favorites by nearly two touchdowns after a  season and a waltz through the playoffs
united nations  the united states urged other un members at talks sunday to impose broad economic and military sanctions on iraq
western diplomats said the world body is expected to adopt the measures
should the un security council impose comprehensive sanctions it would be the first time since  it has taken such action against a member state
the last time such sanctions were imposed was against the white minority government of rhodesia
western diplomats said they expected up to  positive votes on the member council for sanctions against iraq
they said they expected no vetoes allowing the legally binding measure to be adopted probably on monday
they said cuba was the holdout
us
ambassador thomas r pickering told reporters after closeddoor talks sunday that the council discussed the absolute necessity of moving ahead toward a broad resolution of sanctions
he said he expected a vote monday
pickering said the united states had circulated six or seven drafts of a detailed resolution
it calls for an embargo on iraqs oil exports an embargo on imports to iraq and a halt to all arms and other military supplies for iraq
british ambassador crispen tickell told reporters later that he detected strong support with the exception of one member for action and a vote tomorrow
speaking of iraqi president saddam hussein canadian ambassador l yves fortier declared this madman must be stopped
cuban envoy ricardo alarcon said cuba would vote for sanctions against iraq only if the council imposed sanctions on south africa for occupying namibia israel for occupying palestinian territories and the united states for invading panama
in kuwait the iraqiinstalled provisional government in a statement carried by the iraqi news agency told other countries to refrain from taking punishing measures against it or iraq
the provisional government said countries have to remember they have interests and citizens in kuwait
kuwaits un
ambassador mohammad abulhasan told reporters that the iraqiinstalled government was employing pure blackmail by saying it could not ensure the safety of foreigners if their governments support sanctions
in aspen colo british prime minister margaret thatcher renewed her call for the united nations to apply a total economic embargo against iraq unless it withdraws immediately from kuwait
iraqs invasion of kuwait defies every principle for which the un stands
if we let it succeed no small country can ever feel safe again
the law of the jungle takes over she said in remarks at the aspen institute
the un role in the iraqkuwait crisis assumed increasing importance after divided arab nations cancelled an emergency summit on the invasion
on thursday the security council condemned iraqs invasion demanded immediate and unconditional troop withdrawal and threatened to impose sanctions if iraq did not pull out
sundays session was scheduled after weekend meetings of the councils five permanent members  the united states the soviet union china britain and france  and between the united states and representatives of the nonaligned movement
they are the nations with the power to veto proposals
the united states contends that stiff sanctions by a united international front are necessary to punish iraq and to force it to withdraw from kuwait which was invaded thursday
an iraqi airways jet carrying  foreigners and a number of iraqi citizens arrived today the first commercial flight allowed out of iraq since it invaded kuwait a japanese embassy spokesman said
the mostly japanese tourists arrived at amman airport at  pm  am edt along with  members of an iraqi football team said the spokesman on condition of anonymity
it was not immediately known if there were americans on board

thousands of westerners have been stranded in kuwait and iraq since iraq invaded kuwait on thursday
they include more than  who were on a british airways flight that was caught in the unrest in kuwait
a british airways spokeswoman said today a substantial number of those passengers arrived safely in baghdad on monday
among the passengers were  americans who also turned up in a baghdad hotel and appear to be fine a us official said in washington
in addition a kuwaiti businessman said about  people a day were fleeing kuwait through the desert to saudi arabia
the businessman who arrived in london on a british airways flight from bahrain today said kuwaitis and expatriates including westerners were joining convoys to escape the iraqi forces
jordans borders with iraq had been closed from the iraqi side since thursday morning when iraq invaded kuwait
the provisional government of free kuwait set up by iraq had threatened sunday to hold hostage citizens of countries imposing sanctions on it
a us diplomat said washington had instructed american citizens living in or visiting iraq and kuwait to leave when circumstances permit
sir the argument for an independent central bank is that it should be free of party political interference not that it should conduct monetary policy without regard to national regional or global interests
whatever policy the kohl government followed over reunification it was bound to unleash a large federal deficit and inflationary pressures in germany
as the western german population is now aware german reunification needs a strong growing west german economy to finance the subsidisation of eastern germans living standards until there is a sustained upswing in the east  even if at the cost of higher german inflation than the bundesbank would wish
in europe as a whole very high real interest rates threaten to turn recession into depression
the governments of europe have been remarkably patient with the bundesbank although it is threatening nearly  years of european effort for greater economic and political integration
surely there must be compromise of some economic habits to achieve the latter
it is ironic that just when german reunification presented a shortterm reason for germany to shift its antiinflationary economic and monetary priorities accommodating european convergence bundesbank intransigence is threatening the emu commitment
beyond europe the dominant economic forces are strongly disinflationary
but germany is the one economy which for reasons of reunification could afford a more relaxed stand on the inflationary front
yet mr otmar issing the bundesbanks chief economist advises there are no grounds for a cut in germanys interest rates
this despite the unreliability of german money supply data
the german government might point out to the bundesbank that monetary targets might be achievable only at the cost of many more than m unemployed in germany of the destruction of the emu programme and global depression
a dm exchange rate adjustment within the erm is not the answer to the problems
we need a prolonged lowinterestrate german reunification boom
the european currency bloc is overvalued against the dollar and yen as a result of bundesbank interest rate policies
and this is aggravating recession
a future europeanwide central bank must clearly  like the us federal reserve  be more accountable in the broader european political and economic interest
the governments and central banks of europe and the g block  including the kohl administration  should pressurise the bundesbank and be prepared to consider constitutional changes if necessary to halt this idiocy

a natural substance called transforming growth factor beta appears to be able to limit damage to cardiac cells following a heart attack according to a study published in the journal science
in a study at the jefferson medical college in philadelphia a group of laboratory rats induced to have heart attacks suffered  percent less cell damage after injections of transforming growth factor beta than did rats that did not receive the tgf beta
tgf beta is a growth factor that opposes some of the bad guys following a heart attack said dr allan m lefer a professor at jefferson
lefer said his research team simulated heart attacks in  rats by partially blocking key arteries in their hearts
in  of the rats the researchers injected a placebo
in the other  they injected transforming growth factor beta
for those who received the tgf beta said lefer the damage from the attack was much less severe
there was about  percent less injury with tgf beta than without it
the extent of heart cell damage was determined by measuring the amount of creatine kinase in the heart tissue following an attack
hearts damaged when the blood supply is interrupted as in a heart attack tend to lose creatine kinase said lefer
thus by measuring for the loss of this substance researchers could determine the amount of heart damage
lefer said the tgf beta seems to block the action of other substances such as tumor necrosis factor that can cause blood vessels to narrow following a heart attack
narrowed blood vessels carry less oxygenrich blood to cells and this causes additional injury following a heart attack
tgf beta is normally present in heart cells but the study published in science said that it is missing from rat heart cells damaged by a simulated heart attack
though tgf beta is produced naturally in the body lefer said his research team used a substance produced artificially by genentech a california biotechnology firm
lefer said his team is now conducting additional studies with tgf beta and that any experimental treatment of human heart attack victims with the substance is at least a year away
jefferson medical college where the study was done is part of thomas jefferson university in philadelphia
science which published the study is the journal of the american association for the advancement of science
a yacht built for adolf hitler and sunk with great fanfare to commemorate the voyage of the damned was mistakenly dropped on a delicate coral reef in a shallow shipping lane officials said tuesday
theyre going to have to move it said coast guard spokeswoman veronica cady
the foot ostwind yacht was supposed to become an artificial reef in  feet of water about two miles off the coast
it was sunk june   years after the us coast guard turned away the ss st louis as its more than  jewish passengers were seeking refuge from the holocaust
the sinking site was supposed to be near where the coast guard intercepted the st louis whose passengers also were turned away by cuba and forced to return to europe
most of the passengers later died in nazi concentration camps
for unexplained reasons the ostwind was pushed off a barge about a mile north of the site and is resting in  feet of water on a living reef
it was truly an incredible incredible historic event and suddenly  boom
 somebody made a mistake said mayor abe resnick a holocaust survivor and a sponsor of the event
federal and dade county officials who allowed resnick to sink the boat are upset about the result
they didnt even come close complained susan markely an administrator with dades environmental department
coast guard lt al crespo said the yacht is balanced on a delicate living reef threatening damage to coral and sponges
its also close to an anchoring spot for freighters and other vessels heading to the port of miami and has been marked with a flashing buoy he said
its close enough that if a ship swings on its anchor it could hit it crespo said
the army corps of engineers said the ostwind must be moved or cut to pieces by june 
if its not the government will remove it and bill resnick
resnick blames the mistake on am daly jr captain of the tug that towed the yacht to where it was sunk
daly however said chris cadley captain of a passenger boat that accompanied him had agreed to lead him to the site
cadley denied that saying he only agreed to meet daly off the coast
resnick said someone will have to pay
i thinks thats going to end up being decided by attorneys said ben mostkoff the countys artificial reef director
the ostwind was built at hitlers direction although he rarely used it
after world war ii the badly decayed boat wound up in the hands of a jacksonville marina owner
the international community is starting to look beyond the conflict in the former yugoslavia and is becoming increasingly aware of the true magnitude and seriousness of ethnic and political conflicts in the former soviet union
the problem is indeed a pressing one
the disputes in the transcaucasus central asia and elsewhere in the former soviet union are causing great suffering for those involved
they are a source of legitimate concern to the russians who are worried by clashes close to their borders
they are concerned too about the safety of ethnic russians living in those countries where there are conflicts and about the economic and social consequences of refugees fleeing to russia whose potential number is estimated at more than m
they believe that the problems in some of the former soviet republics are either ignored or misunderstood
the russians fear that if they do nothing the conflicts will worsen and probably spread
they argue that they have a legitimate concern in trying to resolve conflicts that threaten their security
they ask why when the international community is engaged in peacemaking and peacekeeping in many of the worlds trouble spots similar efforts should not be undertaken in the hot spots near them
equally these disputes are of legitimate concern to britain its western partners and the whole international community both for humanitarian reasons and because such flashpoints risk provoking regional instability
if uncontrolled they pose a variety of threats to european security including increased traffic in drugs and arms as well as international terrorism
crises in russias newly independent neighbours may also complicate russias relations with the west unless they are carefully handled they risk prejudicing the emerging relationship between us
the west is sometimes suspicious of moscows attitude
there are no differences about the need to resolve these conflicts but there are differences over how to go about it
the british government will not underwrite russian involvement unless it is sure that peacekeeping troops will not turn into occupying forces
nor are countries that secured their independence when the soviet union was dissolved keen that the west should concede to moscow the same role it played in the soviet empire
they fear that this would compromise their sovereignty
when they are willing for russian troops to play a peacekeeping role they want there to be some form of international monitoring
this has meant that even though the west lacks the resources to engage directly in those trouble spots it has been wary of appearing to endorse russian involvement instead in case it had imperial tendencies
if we are to fashion a joint approach by russia and its western partners to the problem of peacekeeping in the former soviet union we must address all these concerns
clearly russia has an important role to play in this area
if the russians want international recognition and more active support from the international community the west in turn needs guarantees that russia will not regard recognition of its involvement as giving it carte blanche in the former soviet union
peacekeeping in the former soviet union as indeed peacekeeping elsewhere must comply with internationally recognised principles
it needs to be looked at on a case by case basis
respect for the sovereignty of the newly independent countries must remain paramount
we agreed that the principles underlying russian cis or international peacekeeping operations would need to include strict respect for the sovereignty of the countries involved an invitation from the government concerned and the consent of the parties to the conflict commitment to a parallel political peace process a clear mandate setting out the role of the peacekeeping forces which should whenever possible be multinational in character and an exit strategy for the peacekeeping forces deployed
these principles should help stimulate a dialogue and political settlement between the parties to the conflict focus attention and where possible resources on the settlement of conflicts in the former soviet union
all this will help enhance russian peacekeeping practices
although the conference for security and cooperation in europe and the un lack the resources to put large numbers of peacekeepers on the ground themselves they may be able to suggest measures to enhance transparency and to monitor the peace process
extending cooperation within the north atlantic cooperation council and also cooperation between russia and nato might help improve training for russian peacekeepers
this is an area we shall need to explore further
we also need to put much more emphasis on preventive diplomacy
one of the ways in which we can help prevent conflicts is to strengthen the democratic institutions in the newly independent countries of the former soviet union
the csce and other international institutions can play an important role here drawing the newly independent countries into a more active dialogue on ways of promoting democratic values and principles
we discussed ways of strengthening the csces role including the role of the high commissioner for national minorities at the recent rome ministerial meeting
we must try to find ways of managing and resolving tensions before they erupt into conflict
it will not be easy but we must try
potentially explosive cocktails of ethnic and political animosities could spread the fire of intolerance all too easily to other countries and regions
we need to deal with it together in the spirit of partnership
and we need to deal with it urgently
our security is indivisible and we must ensure it by vigorous and imaginative efforts aimed at promoting peace for all as well as rights for all

exotic kashmir a tourist paradise of houseboat hotels and mogul gardens from whose name the english made cashmere has become a war zone of separatism and religious enmity
military jeeps carry senior government officials and civil servants around srinagar in these dangerous days as soldiers and paramilitary troopers try to stop a campaign of violence by moslem separatists in the kashmir valley
intelligence officer mk
kaul commands one of the jeeps
at the beginning of a trip through the city of  million people he turned to the four soldiers in the jeeps rear seats and ordered check your weapons
be ready to fire
kaul settled into the front seat a mm pistol in his right hand
these are bad days he murmured
these diehard terrorists can attack from anywhere
to his men he said shoot them if you see them
on monday an aroundtheclock curfew was lifted from  am until noon and stores opened to crowds of customers
soldiers in sandbagged bunkers armed with light machine guns guarded main intersections
a spokesman for the jammukashmir state government said the situation was peaceful and absolutely normal in srinagar the states largest city
at least  people have been killed since the crackdown began jan  in an effort to curb attacks on government officials and buildings
most of the dead have been moslem militants shot by indian troops
we are neither fighting a war nor trying to suppress any popular movement said jagmohan governor of jammukashmir the only state in predominantly hindu india with a moslem majority
we are fighting a handful of terrorists who are determined to create a law and order problem said jagmohan a hindu with a reputation for toughness
other officials in kashmir say privately the situation is critical perhaps the most serious threat india has faced in  years of independence from britain
it looks like everyone here has turned into a fundamentalist with firm belief that the day is not far off when they will become independent a state police officer said
kashmir was a separate kingdom ruled by a hindu maharajah when britain relinquished colonial rule on aug   and the subcontinent was partitioned on religious lines into india and pakistan
the hindu king opted to join india not pakistan and the dispute over kashmir has exacerbated relations since
pakistan took the western part of kashmir and india the eastern
each accused the other of forcible occupation
they have fought wars over kashmir and the border question remains unresolved
un observers are stationed on the truce line and the two sides occasionally trade gunfire
officials will not say how many reinforcements have been sent to the kashmir valley since jan  but reports from various sources indicate and  soldiers and paramilitary troops have been deployed
it is the valleys heavily moslem population that tilts the sectarian scale in jammukashmir state
of the states nearly  million people  percent are moslems and  percent hindus
most hindus live in the southern jammu area
srinagar has  mosques
this is the best breeding ground for moslem fundamentalism said a federal official who helps coordinate the new security measures
nearly every mosque has a loudspeaker to summon the faithful to prayer  and more recently to exhort listeners to defend their faith and kashmir
the residents are constantly bombarded with islamic sermons and are reminded that fighting a jihad islamic holy war is the most sacred duty of every moslem the federal official said on condition of anonymity
electricity was cut off in the city friday which was both the moslem sabbath and indias national republic day on indias republic day but many mosque loudspeakers continued operating because militants connected them to car batteries
intelligence reports suggest the government has an advantage because the separatists are not united
the most powerful group is the jammukashmir liberation front but there are several others including the allah tigers hezbemujahed hezbeislami
india claims the fundamentalists get money and weapons from pakistan
the pakistanis deny it
jagmohan the governor insists the main issue in kashmir is economic development not separatism
the people do not want violence or the socalled independent kashmir he said
the need of the hour is development
let more tourists come

the hubble space telescope was awakened from its selfinduced sleep today but it was still without the use of its highspeed antennas and its science instruments were on hold unable to begin any observations
we are out of the safemode right now said steve terry a supervisor of the engineers controlling the telescope
he said the telescope was running on a normal controlall mode where its own computers and sensors guide where it is pointing
discoverys astronauts meanwhile packed their gear for a return to earth sunday made some lastminute observations of earth and talked with groundbased reporters about their flight
pilot charles bolden said he was especially upbeat about the widespread public awareness of the telescope which is expected eventually to look back  billion light years  nearly to the birth of the universe
its hard to go somewhere and find someone who has never heard of the hubble space telescope said bolden
it makes little kids eyes light up
it makes little kids want to learn how to add and subtract and study science
the telescopes big eye has remained open but hubble had been in a safe mode with all motion stopped because of earlier problems in linking the highspeed dish antennas with a relay satellite
the antennas are the primary links for relaying scientific data to the ground
terry said that even in the safe mode one of the tape recorders in the telescope reads telemetry signals from all its systems and that these would be played to earth and analyzed when the antennas are working properly
we expect to use that data to investigate what happened he said
engineers are able to send commands to the telescope via its secondary antennas but the communications system is not useful for scientific data which must be transmitted at a high rate of speed
were putting the scientific instruments in a hold mode in effect a standby mode he said
shortly after  am edt controllers at the goddard space flight center in greenbelt md completed a series of commands that took the telescope out of its safe mode and then began to run a hour computer program to monitor hubbles health
it will take another day before the  billion telescope is operating the way it was supposed to at this point in the startup process said hubble deputy project manager jean olivier
were backing up to a very deliberate and slow and careful approach to these problems olivier said friday
this is not the time to do anything dumb
the telescope problems have put the flight center several days behind but the five astronauts who deployed it earlier this week were sticking to their schedule
landing is scheduled for  am edt sunday at edwards air force base calif but flight controllers were keeping a close watch on the weather
winds were predicted to be about  mph with gusts up to  mph
mission rules dictate that headwinds cannot exceed  mph at touchdown
the shuttle carries enough supplies to stay in orbit three days beyond sunday if necessary nasa said
mission control awakened the crew members at about  am edt today by playing the song cosmos
thanks for the wakeup music its pretty appropriate for today said commander loren shriver
the song was selected in honor of hubble space telescope which is now open for business said mission control commentator james hartsfield
the astronauts were to finish up their experiments and photography today and pack for the trip home
they also planned to hold a news conference from space with reporters at the johnson space center
shriver and pilot charles bolden were to run through a series of tests to make certain the shuttles computers and control jets were ready for return to earth
the crew deployed hubble on wednesday but they had stayed close to the telescope in case there was trouble opening the aperture door
mission specialists bruce mccandless and kathryn sullivan were prepared to perform a space walk today to crank it open in orbit  miles above earth
but that proved unnecessary when the door was opened friday morning exposing the telescopes finely polished inch eye to starlight for the first time
two of hubbles four positionstabilizing gyroscopes stopped working when the door opened but engineers later got them back on line
the gyroscopes were knocked out by the motion and that too kept the telescope in the safe mode said dave drachlis director of orbital verifications at goddard
a colleague steve terry said hubbles systems were set at conservative limits for the first operations and that caused many malfunctions
there also were two communications outages totaling several hours
hubble is designed with safe modes so it can be the master of its own destiny in case contact with an orbiting communications system is lost for extended periods terry said
nasa had planned to release its first test image from the telescope on tuesday showing an open star cluster in the constellation carina
but terry said that would be delayed because of the antenna problems
scientific data will follow in a month or two
the telescope named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble will enable astronomers over its year working lifetime to look back  billion years and possibly determine the age of the universe
the universe is believed to have been created about  billion years ago in a cosmic explosion
hubble provided the basis for the bigbang theory of creation
he discovered during the s that the universe is expanding and that the farther the galaxy is from earth the faster it is moving away
taking a break from the headaches of the palestinian uprising and israels election campaign thousands of israelis turned out saturday for a canine beauty pageant
marco a feisty boxer owned by dov amir padded off with the champions trophy after beating out  other pretty pooches in israels dogoftheyear contest held in tel avivs exhibition center
we can find time for other things besides the intefadeh said organizer avi marshak using the arabic word for uprising to describe the monthold wave of palestinian violence aimed at ending israels occupation of the west bank and gaza strip
about  people attended the twoday show organizers said
israeli couples in cutoff jeans and shortsleeved shirts pushed baby strollers from ring to ring to view the more than  different breeds ranging from tiny lap dogs like the yorkshire terriers to great danes and st bernards
marshak said the contest was sanctioned by the world kennel club based in brussels belgium and had judges from the netherlands south africa italy and britain
but although the competition was billed as an international event organizers conceded there were few if any contestants from abroad
this was in contrast to  before the uprising began when a world dog show competition attracted scores of foreign competitors to israel
even so we dont feel the intefadeh here said rafi shahaf a veterinarian who was interviewed in the show ring where conan his steel gray mastino napoletano had just taken a blue ribbon
the show briefly pushed the nov  general elections out of the limelight for the doglovers
experts say the razortight race between the rightwing likud party and the leftleaning labor party could determine the future of the israelioccupied palestinian lands
president corazon aquino today reversed a longheld policy and said she was willing to negotiate ceasefires with communist guerrillas and former soldiers who have staged coup attempts
mrs aquino also invited the opposition to join the talks including her most outspoken critic sen juan ponce enrile
manila has been rocked by almost daily explosions
although no one has claimed responsibility for the blasts the government has blamed them on former soldiers who have repeatedly tried to toppled mrs aquino in coup attempts
the communist rebels have been waging a year rebellion to establish a marxist state
the last ceasefire with them collapsed in early 
sen wigberto tanada called for a truce between the government and the communist rebels after a major earthquake in the philippines on july  but mrs aquino rejected the proposal
on tuesday a proaquino senator orlando mercado urged mrs aquino to put aside differences with her political foes and begin to discuss the nations security problems and economic woes
enrile said he was willing to reconcile with mrs aquino who fired him as defense minister after he was implicated in a coup attempt in november 
mrs aquino said in a statement today that mercado and enrile are welcome to join discussions now being held by a committee of cabinet members
defense secretary fidel ramos has adamantly refused any ceasefire with the communist guerrillas since november  when the aquino government negotiated with the rebels during a day truce
ramos a member of the cabinet committee has been credited with crushing six coup attempts against mrs aquino
communists have accused him of whipping up threats of another coup attempt against mrs aquino so that the civilian leadership would become indebted to him
ramos has denied all allegations
the last ceasefire with the rebels collapsed in january  after troops fired on farmers demonstrating outside mrs aquinos office for land reform
check about  black pastors representing congregations totaling more than  million churchgoers in  states held a rally on the steps of the supreme court and then lobbied their senators to support confirmation of president bushs supreme court nominee
 the ministers were recently organized into a conservative coalition for the restoration of the black family and society with the first item on its agenda being thomas confirmation
 check a television ad supporting thomas shown in four southern states where senators face reelection campaigns next year attracted  calls between friday and sunday according to gary bauer organizer of the conservative citizens committee to confirm clarence thomas which financed the ads production
 the ad carries a tollfree telephone number that viewers are asked to call to register their support for thomas callers are then sorted by states and the state lists will be sent to the targeted senators
 check on the other side of the thomas confirmation issue the national abortion rights action league reported that senators had begun to receive the first of  antithomas post cards the group has provided to the constituents of targeted lawmakers whose votes against thomas confirmation are regarded as critical
 check the lawyers committee for civil rights under law a bipartisan group organized in  to assist the government in civilrights law enforcement announced that  of about  members of its board of directors had decided to oppose thomas confirmation
the announcement said thomas legal philosophy reflected a hostility to and rejection of the core of civil rights jurisprudence
new treatments that stop a heart attack in its tracks may help victims to get out of the hospital more quickly than ever before perhaps even three days after their attacks a study published today concludes
doctors from the university of michigan medical center studied the effects of sending a few carefully selected heart patients home early
they found that these people had no unusual complications got back to work sooner and had substantially lower medical bills
it was an extraordinarily safe strategy said dr eric j topol the studys director
there were no problems with any serious events
topol said the early discharges were made possible by two recent medical advances  tissue plasminogen activator or tpa and angioplasty
when given quickly after a heart attack tpa can dissolve clots in the hearts arteries and minimize damage
angioplasty can produce similar results by opening up the clogged arteries with tiny balloons
the report represents the latest in a steady threedecade trend of sending heart attack patients home from the hospital after ever shorter stays
however the study in the new england journal of medicine said more research is needed before the findings are widely adopted
in the s doctors often recommended that patients stay in bed for one to two months after a heart attack
when president dwight d eisenhower suffered an uncomplicated heart attack in  he spent seven weeks recovering in the hospital
however doctors learned that long inactivity did more harm than good
patients got out of shape developed blood clots and became demoralized
in the s the stay was shortened to three weeks and in the s to two weeks
now doctors typically keep heart attack patients hospitalized seven to  days
in their paper the doctors determined that  of the  heart attack patients studied were healthy enough to be considered for early discharge
none of them had irregular heart beats chest pain or heart failure
treadmill tests showed no signs of heart attack damage
forty patients were sent home after three days while the rest stayed seven to  days
after six months of followup none had died and the number of medical problems in both groups was similar
however people in the early discharge group were able to return to work about two weeks sooner than the others and their medical bills were significantly lower   versus 
the researchers estimated that if  percent of all heart attack patients were discharged after three days the annual saving would be at least  million
in an accompanying editorial dr gregory d curfman a deputy editor of the journal cautioned that the study was not large enough to spot complications that might result from reducing hospital stays
this single study he wrote is not sufficient to justify sweeping changes in current management practices for all patients who may at first appear to have uncomplicated heart attacks

asked several times by sen herb kohl dwis about womens right to end their pregnancies thomas said whether or not i have a view is irrelevant
 president bush asked at a news conference whether thomas claim not to have an opinion on abortion is credible answered thats a question for the senate to decide
 hes handling himself very well the president said
i think hes doing a beautiful job up there
i feel more confident than ever that he will be confirmed
 thomas answers have frustrated the committees democrats who say he is an evasive witness
they also have voiced skepticism about his backing away from stands he took in past writings and speeches
 committee chairman joseph biden ddel began to show signs of exasperation today during spirited questioning about the nominees views on natural law a theory that certain rights exist independent of written law
 at one point biden accused thomas of using tortuous logic
later he referred to one of thomas replies as the most unartful dodge ive heard
after still another thomas answer biden said thats not the question i asked you judge
 republicans tried to deflect criticism over thomas refusal to answer questions from the democrats
 it is in my view inappropriate to keep this up said sen orrin hatch rutah
he said thomas had been asked more than  questions about his abortion views even though justice david h souter was asked only  such questions during his confirmation hearings last year
 what are we going to have
sixtyfourthousand questions on abortion before were done with this approach
hatch asked
enough is enough
 thomas said senate confirmation of his nomination would give him an opportunity to serve and give back and to bring something different to the court
 i can walk in the shoes of the people who are affected by what the court does thomas said
 several senators were openly skeptical wednesday over thomas insistence that he has no opinion on the  supreme court decision legalizing abortion
 if thats so said sen paul simon dill hes the only person gathered in the room who does not have an opinion
 kohl added im concerned about his candor his willingness to be forthcoming
 today kohl asked the nominee is it fair of you to say to us for the most part just view me on what im saying here this week
 kohl asked the black federal judge whether he was offended by published comments calling his appointment by president bush a quota
 that would trouble anyone thomas said adding i dont think its accurate
he said bush assured him he was picked because he was the best qualified of those potential nominees considered
 thomas is expected to continue testifying through friday
the committee next week will hear from other witnesses
 two pivotal members of the member committee  howell heflin dala and arlen specter rpa  also voiced concern about thomas answers
but the panels traditional third swing vote dennis deconcini dariz said thomas was doing well
 thomas opponents believe republicans strom thurmond of south carolina hatch charles grassley of iowa alan simpson of wyoming and hank brown of colorado are solid thomas backers
 but they hope sens
edward m kennedy dmass and howard metzenbaum dohio will be joined by the three swingvote senators and biden patrick leahy of vermont simon and kohl in voting against the nominee
 thomas views excerpts from clarence thomas testimony on abortion i have no reason or agenda to prejudge the issue 
or a predilection to rule one way or another on the issue of abortion
 on affirmative action the line that i drew was a line that said that we shouldnt have preferences or goals or timetables or quotas
 on natural law at no time did i feel nor do i feel now that natural law is anything more than the background to our constitution
 hear it see it senate confirmation hearings for supreme court nominee clarence thomas are scheduled to run through friday this week and every weekday except wednesday next week

thursdays acquittals in the mcmartin preschool molestation case outraged parents who said prosecutors botched it while those on the defense side proclaimed a triumph of justice over hysteria and hype
motherandson defendants peggy mcmartin buckey  and raymond buckey  wept as the verdicts were announced
jurors found the pair innocent of  charges and couldnt reach a verdict on  other counts
prosecutors must decide whether to try those charges in a new trial
i just said i told you ray mrs buckey said
asked if her son was surprised she said
he had fear definitely
buckey avoided reporters and slipped out the courthouse with his lawyer
if it can happen to seven innocent people it can happen to you too
if it had not been in my faith in god i wouldnt be here today she said
but several parents of former students at the school said the buckeys won because the system lost
it was never done properly said parent alan lagunoff who moved to central california from suburban manhattan beach
i have to sit back and figure out what to do with my son
i fear that because of this verdict no child will be seen as a credible witness from now on
his son now  attended the school for  years but wasnt a witness at the trial
i dont think its worth it to bring this thing back into the courts
it will just be another sixyear travesty lagunoff said
the system is not going to protect children said jackie mcgauley a parent who believes her child had been molested but didnt testify in the case
i dont know what the message is that the jury wanted to get out
im anxious to hear that
charles buckey father of raymond and husband of mrs buckey suggested deputy district attorney lael rubin who prosecuted the case for its entire six years was motivated by personal ambition
my concern primarily was lael rubin who is anything goes in order to secure a conviction
if you dont win you dont get promoted he said
juror brenda williams said the evidence failed to convince the jury beyond a reasonable doubt in  of the charges
even if you accept that the children were molested it didnt necessarily mean they were molested at the mcmartin preschool ms williams told reporters
raymond buckey spent nearly five years in jail without bail during the case which defense attorneys said was the result of community hysteria sparked by bizarre allegations by the alcoholic mother of one child at the preschool
some observers accused thendistrict attorney robert philibosian of using the spectacular charges to boost his failing reelection campaign against ira reiner who beat him and now runs the district attorneys office
philibosian however insisted he would not have handled the matter differently
ira reiner has had that case for five years and i am not going to take any public criticism directed at me
let him respond to the criticism said philibosian now in private law practice
also criticized was the decision by investigators to use a private child therapy group childrens institute international to conduct the original interviews with the children
defense attorneys maintained that questions by the institutes researchers were leading and prejudicial
jurors agreed
we never got the childrens stories in their own words said juror john breese
childrens institute officials didnt immediately return telephone calls seeking comment
originally there were seven defendants including raymond buckeys sister peggy ann buckey and virginia mcmartin the founder of the school mother of mrs buckey and grandmother of raymond buckey
hundreds of allegations of child molestation were filed in the case which gained worldwide attention with its tales of underground tunnels at the school and satanic rituals
the focus of the case shifted dramatically over the years as reiner reduced the number of charges and dropped five defendants after reviewing the case
the underground tunnels were never found
no proof was ever produced of satanic rituals
reiner said the system must be changed to prevent such long expensive prosecution
it took far too long and cost far too much money to have what has been called perfect justice
we need reform reiner said adding that in trying to describe the case insane is the word that comes to mind
the case was the longest and the costliest in american judicial history at  years and  million
superior court judge william pounders said he did what he could to limit its length cutting  witnesses and narrowing the scope of the case
for parents and others there was more to ponder than legal questions
life is not fair
i tell my children all the time  there is no such thing as fair said robert currie whose son attended mcmartin but didnt testify at the trial
its really a travesty for a case to take this long said ms rubin the prosecutor
not only for the families the children in this case but also for the defendants as well
hurricane hugo struck south carolina with renewed fury thursday after thousands of coastal residents in southeastern states grabbed what they could carry and fled inland on jammed highways
this is a disaster staring us right in the eye mayor joseph p riley jr said from his city hall command post in charleston where the hurricane downed power lines snapped trees and caused utility transformers to explode
all we can do now is pray and hope all the precautions we have taken have been sufficient riley said as hugos eye bore in on the city
i just hope and pray we can get through this without any loss of life
by midnight  mph winds were reported in charleston
the roof cracked at city hall a yearold brick building that has withstood several hurricanes and torrents of water poured into the paneled council chamber
phone and electric service to the command post was knocked out
hurricaneforce winds first hit the coast by  pm edt and about three hours later the eye of the storm passed over the isle of palms just east of charleston said bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral gables fla
the eye was about  miles across and top winds were still at  mph
hugo was expected to turn gradually to the north causing severe flooding as it moved up the east coast
the storm posed a  percent chance of hitting new york city and a  percent chance of hitting boston before sunday night the hurricane center said
as hugo neared the coast roads from hilton head to myrtle beach  miles north were nearly empty as were the boardedup resort towns themselves
power lines and trees were downed in some spots and water flooded roads
stop lights and neon lights were knocked out in myrtle beach
one eyewitness said its like a light show said amy garrison a reporter at wkzq amfm in myrtle beach
in charleston the hurricane littered streets with tin roofs palmetto fronds and chunks of bark
businesses were closed and classes at public schools and universities canceled
riley ordered residents of onestory homes to evacuate
hospitals stockpiled supplies discharging any patients well enough to go and moving others to hospitals inland to make room for emergency patients officials said
about  people had checked into  shelters across the state as of thursday evening and more were expected said bennish brown a spokesman for the emergency operations center in columbia  miles northwest of here
we tried to close the doors but people are sneaking in side doors said elaine skelton a registered nurse working at the conway high school shelter near myrtle beach
we tried to post guards at the doors but people were still coming in
american red cross relief efforts were buckling under the number of evacuees said brian ruberry a spokesman in savannah ga who appealed for help
right now the red cross is sheltering tens of thousands of people all along the eastern seaboard
this of course is at the same time that were sheltering  people on puerto rico and the other caribbean islands
were beginning to feel the squeeze
our resources are very tight
right now hugo is shaping up to be one of our biggest relief operations of the decade
at midnight the center of hugo was near latitude  degrees north and longitude  degrees west forecasters said
the hurricanes speed had picked up to  mph from  mph earlier
near its center hugos muscle reached winds of  mph up from  mph earlier in the day and  mph the day before
north and south carolina can expect tornadoes linked to hugo for the next two days according to the hurricane center
the coastal area could expect hurricane force winds for  to  hours once the eye comes ashore officials said
a hurricane warning was in effect between fernandina beach fla and oregon inlet nc by late afternoon hugo was upgraded to a category  hurricane on the saffirsimpson scale of strength the second mightiest category which indicated it could cause extreme damage
it strengthened more than we thought it would sheets said adding that hugo would cause severe flooding as it moved up the appalachians
the timing of the landfall was critical because of the storms tidal surge a dome of water  to  feet high that would feed a normal foot high tide that peaks after  am on top of that will be waves sheets said earlier and in many places on barrier islands the buildings will be swept clean off
well it did turn out to be rain mans evening but not until the last few minutes and if there was a message in wednesday nights academy awards results its that parity has returned to hollywood
for twothirds of the show the academy voters seemed determined to give an award to every film nominated
as it was  different movies split  awards the most winners for one year in this decade
the major awards made the forecasters look smart and the academy predictable
rain man did win the grand prize and three other big ones and mississippi burning with just one oscar for cinematography did get punished for its highly publicized historical muddling
but gone for a refreshing change was the slate voting that has turned many recent academy awards shows into onenote evenings that kept some deserving people out of the oscar resale market
rain man its director barry levinson hoffman and the screenwriters the two of several who worked on it may have fulfilled their roles as favorites but there were no sure things elsewhere and people looking for early patterns had to throw away the form
the final score shows rain man with four oscars and dangerous liaisons and who framed roger rabbit with three each
but there were seven other films with one award each
whether the spread represents a change in voting habits or an absence of a film to rally around it made for a great show and in some cases the awards helped right some wrongs in the nominations process
that who framed roger rabbit won three of the six awards for which it was nominated may save the academy some embarrassment for neglecting the one  film sure to be regarded as a classic
the good news for observers of voter psychology were the awards given to films that were not boxoffice hits
the voters tend to favor those films that are both of substance and commercially successful thus rain man and whether they even bother to see the other nominees is often questioned
this year several winners came from films that failed to ring up big numbers at the box office jodie foster as best actress from the accused geena davis as best supporting actress from the accidental tourist
more surprising were the awards given to bird and the milagro beanfield war films that divided critics and sent moviegoers off to the video store looking for alternatives
both films were flawed but the sound editing done for bird which seamlessly blended old jazz recordings with fresh studio cuts done by contemporary musicians was brilliant and deserved the award its fourman sound team won
david grusins oscar for scoring the milagro beanfield war overcame even bigger odds winning over popular john williams score for the accidental tourist
the selective mood of the voters is a reflection of the kind of year the film industry had and whether the spread is a quirk one can hope it suggests a trend
the  slate of films was on total a marked improvement over recent years
the industry is still adjusting to its changing  its older and more demanding audience  and that means a wider variety of films
nominees this year represented as wide a range of material as any in years and they produced more winning films
the events last night played hell with the office pool but it made for a better show
maybe its the start of something new
about  east germans many carrying west german flags demonstrated saturday for speedy german reunification the official east german news agency adn said
as the demonstrators rallied in the southern city of plauen west german chancellor helmut kohl said in moscow that soviet president mikhail s gorbachev had given him an unequivocal promise to respect german reunification
kohl declared it a very good day for germany
kohl and foreign minister hansdietrich genscher also disclosed that they expect a reunification plan with agreement of the world war ii allies to be ready before the end of the year for presentation to a paneuropean summit meeting
calls for german reunification have increased since the ouster of the hardline communist leadership and the opening of east germanys borders during the fall prodemocracy movement
despite reforms nearly  east germans most of them skilled workers continue to leave their homeland daily crippling an economy already troubled by strikes and absenteeism
earlier saturday west german finance minister theo waigel said the east german economy was in a sorrowful state and urged the east german government to release details on its financial situation
waigels comments came after a day after a highranking official in bonn warned that east germany is rapidly approaching insolvency
things are escalating waigel said in an interview with west berlin radio
the economy is in a sorrowful state
the political authority is crumbling
he said the bonn government believes east germanys foreign debt stands at  billion
if the situation has changed the east german government must say so said waigel a conservative who has been pushing for establishment of a common currency for the two states
also saturday more than  east germans protested in front of the soviet embassy in east berlin against the stationing of soviet helicopters in their country adn said
adn said the demonstrators held signs saying gorbi what about disarmament
and tanks out helicopters in
the protesters from the east german town of prenzlau claimed the soviets had backed out of disarmament plans by replacing a tank unit that had been stationed at a military base there with helicopters adn reported
according to adn the demonstrators who came from church and citizens groups as well as from the town council issued a statement calling for civilian use of the base

the damaged battleship uss iowa steamed home from puerto rico on friday while investigators on board interviewed crewmen and reviewed an amateur videotape of the explosion that killed  sailors
ens
karl johnson an atlantic fleet spokesman said the navy would not release the exact position of the ship which was expected to reach its home port here about  pm sunday
the washington post reported in its saturday editions that crewmen in the upper chambers of the gun turret were killed by the explosion and fire while sailors working several levels below suffocated when the blast sucked all the oxygen out of the spaces
navy investigators also said the explosion left two fully loaded gun barrels in the turret the newspaper reported
the explosion came after two of the three guns had been loaded and just after the crew had been given permission to load and fire the center gun the newspaper said
after the fire was extinguished crew men worked quickly to remove the shells and powder from the other two guns before they could explode the newspaper said
meanwhile nbc news reported that the exact cause of the blast in one of the ships three inch gun turrets on wednesday may never be known because the destruction inside the turret was so complete
the navy released photographs of the firefighting effort which authorities said required two hours to put out the blaze and cool off the turret before anyone could enter it
during the trip home investigators on board were reviewing a videotape of the turret taken by an iowa officer who had wanted to record the firing of the big guns when the explosion occurred said lt cmdr
james cudler a pentagon spokesman
he said the investigators had not decided whether to release the tape to the public
investigators were also interviewing crew members
maj tom johnston a spokesman for the atlantic fleet in norfolk said he had no information on the cause of death of the  crewmennavy officials have refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion
in norfolk memorial services for the  victims are tentatively set for  am monday
president george bush is to attend
johnson said the ship is steaming under its own power and repeated the navys daily report that the ship is seaworthy and in no danger
the foot ton battleship has armor up to  inches thick
navy officials have said that the explosion in the no
 gun turret damaged only the turret
the top members of the senate armed services committee said friday the panel will hold hearings on the fiery explosion
the explosion occurred during open seas gun practice  miles north of puerto rico
the pentagon said the blast ripped through the middle gun of the threegun turret and that that gun had not been fired prior to the explosion
the pentagon has ordered that no inch gun will be fired until the investigation is complete
ships with those guns  the battleships iowa new jersey missouri and wisconsin  were built during world war ii
some critics have said the inch guns are outmoded and dangerous
although they are a continent apart the cities of charleston sc and san francisco now share a fateful page in the ledger of time
they are the scenes of two of the centurys costliest backtoback natural disasters hurricane hugo and the bay area earthquake
there are dramatic similarities and profound differences in the ways these two cities were affected and altered in the first week after they were ravaged by two powerful forces of nature  one that angrily swept across the land from the sea and one that violently rumbled beneath the earth
from the standpoint of compassion of all the people in america we can feel the hurt that the san francisco area is going through the most charleston mayor joseph p riley jr said sunday one month after hugo hit
we know it means at best the disruption of normal life for some time and at worst the loss of life
charleston had warning
san francisco did not
unlike earthquakes hurricanes can be tracked by planes and radar their paths predicted with sufficient certainty for those in harms way to secure property and to flee
still at least  deaths in the carolinas are blamed on hugo while at least  deaths have been attributed to the bay area earthquake
hugo  miles across with winds topping  mph left virtually every street and every neighborhood littered with storm debris and  of the citys buildings with some degree of damage
five days after the storm many city residents remained inconvenienced most without electricity many without safe drinking water
street lights didnt work
broken glass and other debris left the roadsides lined with cars stopped by flat tires
by contrast the streets in most of san francisco were passable within a day of the earthquake
electricity was largely restored overnight
and most broken natural gas lines were quickly repaired
restaurants in chinatown north beach and along fillmore street were crowded saturday night
cable cars began carrying passengers sunday and the curtain went up on the opera
their streets were immediately passable said charleston police chief ruben greenberg
we were gridlocked for two days because of the debris
and a week after the hurricane charleston  which like san francisco has a tourismbased economy  was still trying to cope with mountains of broken trees and shattered roofs
it was more than  days before restaurants and other stores began to slowly reopen and twice as long for night life to begin to return
tour buses return by sunday tourists and tour buses could be seen outside hotels near fishermans wharf and at other locations favored by visitors
tourism is a billionayear business in san francisco
it took almost three weeks for businesses that cater to tourists to get back on their feet in charleston
its likely to take a lot longer for the tourists themselves to return in numbers that made it one of the citys biggest industries
citywide charleston had  buildings collapse compared to  buildings destroyed just in san franciscos marina district
in charleston most of the damage could be quickly assessed
it was visible
in san francisco much of the damage may still be undetected
water mains and gas lines weakened by the heaving earth may not break for weeks or months
structural damage to houses in many instances will become apparent over a long period of time
when a hurricane is over its over greenberg said
not so with an earthquake
you have aftershocks
charleston also escaped widespread damage to its infrastructure
we lost no major economic area like the bay bridge said greenberg who was once san franciscos undersheriff and who returned with emergency supplies to help the santa cruz police
thats an economic lifeline
all we lost was one minor bridge
theyre going to have humongous traffic problems
hugo left charleston isolated from the world
communications broke down soon after the storm crossed the coastline about midnight and it was daybreak before the nation began to learn of the widespread damage
even local residents were left without any information
the hurricane knocked out all local television and radio stations and local officials for almost two days depended on a florida radio station to deliver vital information and warnings
millions were watching the pregame world series program when the earthquake struck and instantly word was out that there had been a disaster
san francisco stations were able to broadcast to residents who had batterypowered radios and tvs
damage estimates from hugo have ranged as high as  billion while earthquake damage estimates sunday reached the  billion mark
besides that black page in the ledger of history both san francisco and charleston also have another experience in common both have experienced frustrating delays in getting disaster relief from the federal government
greenberg who has now watched the federal government respond to two of americas worst disasters said he sees relatively few differences between how the federal emergency management agency worked in south carolina and northern california
theres nothing that needs to be done in a hurry with them he said
they just plop along like one of the horses at disneyland
just plop plop plop
they are repeating the mistakes of south carolina in california
iranian news media reacted with little emotion thursday to a killer earthquake that left an estimated  people dead in northern iran
the country has endured several massive tragedies in recent years
an estimated  million iranians were killed or wounded in the eightyear war with iraq that ended in 
and the islamic revolution that in  toppled the late shah mohammed reza pahlavi cost hundreds of thousands of lives
and devastating quakes are not new to the country
about  people died in eastern iran in a  earthquake
roughly the same number died in a december  quake in nearby soviet armenia
the iranian media monitored from nicosia was quick to report thursdays earthquake
within half an hour the islamic republic news agency reported that the tremor had been felt in tehran the capital
but subsequent reports some a few minutes apart said the damage must have been principally to crops with brief mentions that many casualties were feared in zanjan and gilan provinces
the only detail reported for hours was that when the quake hit tehran residents were either asleep or watching a world cup soccer match between brazil and scotland
the report said that many people fled into the streets
in addition the news agencys earliest reports dramatically underestimated the magnitude of the disaster
while irna reported  dead late thursday the iranian ambassador to the united nations said  people had died
official radio was off the air when the earthquake struck and although it came back on the air to report important news during the iraniraq war there was no such move thursday
iranian radio first reported the earthquake on the main newscast   hours later
the radio like the agency also kept listeners informed about the areas hit and the number of casualties
but again the reporting lacked color and description for hours
the televisions first shots from the stricken north were screened  hours after the quake with no comment from reporters
when the scenes were replayed during newscasts the anchors appeared unshaken by chilling clips such as one showing a stuffed toy and a small shoe lying in a street carpeted with debris
iranian president hashemi rafsanjani declared a threeday period of mourning for quake victims
but the television showed cartoons and an educational program for children and ended its programming with live transmission of a world cup soccer match between egypt and england
the scarred battleship uss iowa made a somber return sunday to its home port where about  family members and friends of the crew welcomed loved ones who escaped an explosion that killed  sailors
sailors in whites with black arm bands lined the rails as the huge vessel docked at the norfolk naval bases pier  at  pm just one minute later than navy officials had estimated
twenty minutes later families started filing aboard the ship exchanging tearful embraces with the returning sailors
they wanted to get here on schedule and were anxious to get home said capt
steven karalekas
the explosion wednesday flashed through the iowas no
 gun turret which extends six decks down into the ship
there were  survivors inside the turret all on the lowest deck loading powder from the ships magazines the navy said
two of the surviving crewmen of no
 turret stood on top of the fireblackened turret as the ship pulled into the pier with full crews on the ships two other turrets the navy said
 turret was in the same position as when the explosion occurred facing right with the left and right guns elevated
the center gun where the blast occurred was depressed
when the foot vessel first appeared there were scattered cheers by those on the dock but all remained silent as the ship pulled into the pier
the somber mood was heightened by the lack of bands and few waves were exchanged as the ship docked
adm powell carter commander in chief of the atlantic fleet was on the dock to greet the vessel
as it docked three marines raised a flag to halfmast at the stern of the ship
the navy kept the news media about  yards from the families and reporters were not allowed to talk with the families or the crewmen
the violence and power of the turret explosion was shown in an amateur videotape released by the navy on sunday
the tape was made by an officer on the bridge of the iowa who wanted to record the firing of the big guns
the detonation which appears to blast away the gasketlike rubber bloomers that seal the turrets gun slits is followed by a jet of intense fire and thick smoke from the front and base of the gunhouse
the videotape cut immediately to damage control firefighters spraying heavy streams of water onto the turret
throughout the norfolk area churches dedicated prayers sunday morning to the families of iowa crewmen
we have lost  of our number in a tragic way said cmdr
john l fitzgerald a chaplain in a service at the norfolk naval air station
our faith helps us to handle what science cannot answer the mystery of death
a red rose a yellow ribbon with the number  on it and a book containing the names of the dead were taken to the altar
fitzgerald said the iowa tragedy and that of a recently lost soviet submarine put political differences aside and unite the human family as one
on monday morning president bush will lead a memorial service in a base hangar that can accommodate  people
the families of the victims were invited but navy officials said they did not know how many would attend
none of the victims listed the norfolk area as their hometown
the explosion occurred during exercises off puerto rico
the pentagon said it happened before the middle inch gun of the threegun turret had been fired
the guns the largest on any ship at sea use six pound bags of black powder to fire a pound projectile up to  miles
the navy has refused to speculate on the cause of the explosion which damaged only the inside of the turret
but navy teams who entered the turret immediately after the blast found the no
 guns breech open and undamaged with the practice projectile that the gun was to have fired still there the new york times reported sunday
this indicated the explosion occurred while the powder bags were still being loaded into the gun the times said citing unidentified sources
navy gunnery officers believe the explosion occurred when the bags were being transferred from a powder hoist to the gun the newspaper said
they said flame and hot gases from the blast went down the hoist to the lowest deck if the transfer of powder to the guns had been complete the hoist would have been sealed off
the iowa and its sister ships the battleships missouri new jersey and wisconsin were commissioned during world war ii and mothballed after the korean war
they were recommissioned by the reagan administration in the s
defense secretary dick cheney said sunday that the administration plans to keep all four battleships in the fleet despite the explosion
they are effective they were relatively cheap to bring back into the service compared to new ships they are good cruise missile platforms so i think they do have a role to play cheney said on nbcs meet the press
critics have charged that the battleships inch guns are antiquated and dangerous gunners say they are among the most accurate available
the senate panel weighing john towers nomination to be defense secretary has found a substantial discrepancy in towers descriptions of his business dealings with a british aircraft and weapons manufacturer congressional sources said friday
tower testified last week that he had represented british aerospace inc only on civil aviation matters not as a consultant on military systems
but in a divorce deposition taken in june  tower stated that he had given the company advice on selling certain systems to the defense department
in the deposition tower said he represented the firm on a range of military programs and was paid  a month
records show that the payments continued from june  until december 
also he served on the board of directors of the company the us subsidiary of british aerospace plc
concerns about veracity the discrepancy sources said has prompted concerns about the veracity and completeness of towers testimony before the senate armed services committee the panel hearing testimony on his confirmation
and it raises the question of whether tower should have registered as a lobbyist for foreign interests under the foreign agents registration act they said
towers relationships with arms makers are central to reservations expressed by some senators about his nomination
lawmakers from both parties have said they are concerned that there would be a continuing appearance of conflict of interest hanging over tower because of his employment by weapons firms which brought him at least  in   years  not including the more than  british aerospace paid him
in his testimony tower has described his lobbying and consulting work for a halfdozen us defense firms that do business with the pentagon
the addition of the british firm to the list would add another  and the first foreignbased firm  whose interests could pose a potential conflict
sources said the apparent discrepancy in testimony raises the prospect that tower could be recalled to testify under oath about his work for the firm
tower aides said they had no comment on the matter
a lengthy fbi investigation into towers business dealings and his personal behavior has stalled a vote by the committee on his confirmation
the fbi is looking into new charges about towers alleged drinking womanizing and receipt of campaign contributions and has said that it cannot complete the inquiry for another  days
the fbi is trying to determine whether tower who left the senate in  after  years received illegal corporate campaign contributions from a military electronics firm that later became part of unisys corp sources said friday
the allegation was raised by a witness in the fbis massive ill wind probe into corruption in pentagon weaponsbuying
federal investigators have not uncovered any evidence that tower was aware that his  campaign fund received any illicit contributions from consultants employed by former unisys executive charles f gardner said to be a central figure in the pentagon bribery investigation
a unisys spokesman said friday that the company was conducting an internal inquiry into the matter but had found no evidence of involvement by current corporate employees
armed services committee chairman sam nunn dga and other committee members are said to be troubled by these issues and have indicated that they may vote against tower unless the apparent conflicts and questions are resolved
the sworn deposition about towers business dealings was never filed in court because tower chose not to contest the divorce from his second wife lilla burt cummings
but the document was obtained by the fbi as part of its background investigation of the nominee and is included in the committees file on tower
towers testimony tower told the committee in written and oral testimony that he was employed only by the american unit of british aerospace and that he worked chiefly on selling the companys commercial jets to us airlines
he said also that he advised the firm on us trade legislation and gave opinions on currency fluctuations
tower told the committee that he could recall no actions in connection with any defense activities and did not include his income from british aerospace among his earnings from consulting work done for defense contractors
in the divorce papers however tower said that he went to work for british aerospace inc on june   eight weeks after resigning as chief negotiator in the ussoviet strategic arms reductions talks in geneva
around the same time he entered into lucrative consulting arrangements with major defense firms including rockwell international inc textron inc ltv corp and martin marietta corp
in the deposition tower said that rockwell paid him  a year but said he was underutilized by the firm
he said he advised british aerospace on its chances of selling its training jets fighter planes and missile systems to the pentagon
deposition cites weapons among the british aerospace products tower tried to sell to us military officials were the tornado fighter the hawk trainer the rapier antiaircraft missile and the seawolf shortrange air defense missile for ships according to the deposition
he said in the document that he had been valuable to the firm because he was plugged in in this town and knows the defense business pretty well
he said that his contacts throughout government made him marketable
the complex foreign agents registration act requires individuals working for or representing foreign entities in the united states to register with the justice department
no registration by tower is on file officials said
in related developments  vice president dan quayle talking to reporters on a flight to florida said that he had known tower for eight years and i have never seen him inebriated
i have never seen drinking be a factor in john towers life other than a social glass of wine
those of us who know him worked with him can attest to the fact that he has not had this problem it did not affect him when he was chairman of the senate armed services committee
when asked whether womanizing is a relevant topic for inquiry he replied you have to look at the qualifications of the secretary of defense
whether he will be a capable secretary of defense and do the job of being secretary of defense
lets focus on the qualifications
 towers doctor said friday that he has no evidence to indicate that the former texas senator suffered any medical symptoms of alcoholism
dr r d dignan who performed surgery to remove a polyp from towers colon on jan  said that after the operation he advised tower to limit his drinking to one or two glasses of wine with dinner
 a longtime bush political adviser said that bush knew what he was doing when he named tower to the post and would not withdraw the nomination despite the controversy
as for tower this adviser said hes one tough little sob
and hes not going to back off

the drought may force the government to ease crop acreage controls next year to help the united states rebuild its grain inventories agriculture secretary richard e lyng said monday
but the united states will continue to be a major player in world agriculture and in  should be able to bounce back from this years drought losses he said
lyngs remarks were prepared for delivery at a meeting of farm magazine extension advertising coop and broadcast editors
a larger portion of the united states suffered from some degree of drought stress in may and june than at any point since records began in  he said
moreover on july  about  percent of the contiguous united states was in the severe to extreme drought category he said
in  more than  percent was so rated and in august  more than  percent was in that category
because of the large early season area now experiencing drought in the us  appears to have the potential to approach or exceed the droughtaffected areas of the s and s lyng said
even with the severe drought there will be an adequate supply of food grains and livestock feed grains so that the united states will be able to take care of our domestic needs and our export demand he said
lyng said total consumption of  crops will probably be somewhat less than previously estimated because prices are much higher
but it is important to note that we will have no shortages that we will still be able to accommodate the needs of our overseas buyers he said
gilbert an extremely dangerous hurricane and one of the strongest storms in history roared toward mexicos yucatan peninsula tuesday with  mph winds after battering the dominican republic jamaica and the tiny cayman islands
the hurricane killed at least five people sunday in the dominican republic civil defense officials said
six people died and  were left homeless in jamaica on monday officials there said
prime minister edward seaga said the hurricane swept the full length of jamaica leaving a trail of wreckage behind it
it will take us some time before we can assess the full damage without any doubt seaga said in a statement
but i have no doubt that this going to be the worst disaster that we have experienced in our modern history
communications were down with many stormravaged areas and the death toll was expected to rise with the arrival of damage and casualty reports
the hurricane traveling westward across the caribbean sea was upgraded tuesday to a category  the strongest and deadliest type of hurricane
such storms have maximum sustained winds greater than  mph and can cause catastrophic damage
bob sheets director of the national hurricane center in coral gables fla described gilbert as a great hurricane  in the top  percent historically as far as intensity size and destructive potential
only two category  hurricanes have hit the united states  a  storm that killed  people in florida and hurricane camille which devastated the mississippi coast in  and killed  people
the people who need to be concerned now are those people over on the yucatan peninsula  cancun cozumel that whole area sheets said
mexicos news media reported beachfront hotels were evacuated in the yucatan resorts of cancun and cozumel island
they gave no figures on the numer of evacuees but said people in cancun were being sent from the hotel zone into the city center about  miles away
cozumel is south of cancun and the reports said hotel guests also were being moved to more secure areas away from the shoreline
mexican officials expected the storm to hit in the early morning hours wednesday
at midnight edt the us national weather service said gilbert was centered near latitude  north longitude  west or about  miles eastsoutheast of cozumel
it said gilbert was moving westnorthwest at about  mph with maximum sustained winds of  mph
the center said tropical stormforce winds extend outward up to  miles to the north and  miles to the south of the center
people in the warned areas should have completed all possible preparations for this extremely dangerous hurricane it said
the center said hurricane gilbert was the most intense storm on record in terms of barometric pressure
it said by  pm edt it was measured at  inches breaking the  inches recorded for the  hurricane that devastated the florida keys
thats the lowest pressure ever measured in the western hemisphere said forecaster mark zimmer
there is very serious flooding in the cayman islands erina nichols a tourism official in miami said tuesday after speaking with residents of the islands
the run point community is taking a real beating

patrick edward purdy who turned a powerful assault rifle on a crowded school playground tuesday killing five children and wounding  more had been a student at the school from kindergarten through third grade officials said today
the revelations significance was not immediately clear although it appeared to suggest that the attack at cleveland elementary was not altogether random
police officials said they still had not determined what set off purdy a troubled drifter in his mids with a history of relatively minor brushes with the law
the midday attack which lasted only minutes ended when purdy mortally wounded himself in the head with a pistol leaving his motive unexplained
i dont understand why and i probably wont ever know why said purdys grandmother yearold julia chumbley who lives nearby in lodi
other relatives described purdy as a child alcoholic and a loner who had bounced across america looking for work as a welder
cleveland elementary was in session today although only a little more than  pupils  roughly onefourth of the student body  showed up for classes
those who did attend were greeted at the school by escorts who guided them through a thicket of reporters and cameras
counselors were stationed in each classroom to help the children come to grips with the horror of the previous day
each child was given a stuffed animal at the principals office
teachers said they did not know what to expect
ill just try to get through the day said vicki braga who teaches fourth grade
the front entrance of the school was decorated with bouquets of yellow gladioli purple mums and five red roses
someone also had placed there a pink teddy bear with angels wings
a banner stretched across the front said racists are ugly  lets stop them
the banners message enunciated an early suspicion that the racial composition of the student body might have contributed to purdys motivation
more than  of the  students are the sons and daughters of refugees from southeast asia
police however said there was as yet no evidence that race played a role
whether he had some feelings against the southeast asian community as a whole we havent determined that said stockton police capt
dennis perry
investigators had not yet determined if any teachers at cleveland elementary were there when purdy was in attendance from  to 
his record at the school showed normal behavior officials said
he transferred out in the third grade to a school in sacramento
police investigators last night searched the lodi motel room where purdy had been staying
he had checked in the day after christmas and was paid up through jan 
they found more than  plastic toy soldiers arrayed about the room along with toy jeeps and tanks in what appeared to be a imaginary battle scene
what the significance is i dont know perry said
he obviously had a military hangup of some kind
to the rest of the world he was known as emperor hirohito but in japan his given name was seldom used
in japanese he was simply called tenno heika meaning his majesty the emperor
the foreign habit of using his name rankled some japanese who found it impolite and unnecessary since to them there is only one emperor
some japanese complained that after his death it even became inaccurate to call him hirohito because he has been given the posthumous name showa
in japanese histories he will be recorded as emperor showa the name he chose for his reign soon after he became emperor in 
it means enlightened peace and has been succeeded by heisei or achieving peace the name the government chose for the reign of hirohitos son akihito a few hours after the emperor died jan 
but for the convenience of the rest of the world which is not so able to keep track of the person behind the changed name even official agencies have used the name hirohito in englishlanguage publications
the obituary issued in english by the foreign press center which is supported by the foreign ministry was headed his late majesty the emperor hirohito
englishlanguage newspapers published in japan quickly began using the name showa for hirohito after his death but it did not become truly official until jan  when emperor akihito conducted a ceremony in which showa became the late emperors posthumous name
a stone tablet placed in his tomb is engraved only with the posthumous name and the dates of his death and burial
the custom of renaming emperors after the completion of their reigns began after the death in  of emperor meiji hirohitos grandfather
in japan years are numbered according to the emperors tenure on the throne
thus  became showa  as crown prince hirohito ascended to the throne on dec  when his father emperor taisho died
the year  was showa  and  was showa  until hirohitos death on jan 
now this year is heisei 
the japanese custom of changing imperial names is not unique among world royalty where an individual may have a variety of names and titles in a royal career
in britain prince andrew became the duke of york upon his marriage in 
the national union of mineworkers said an estimated  black gold and coal miners in south africa will begin a strike sunday night for higher wages and better working conditions in what it said would be the largest job action ever to affect the mining industry in that nation
the strike initially would cover more than half of south africas gold mines and about onefifth of its coal mines said cyril ramaphosa the unions general secretary
if workers in mines not included in current negotiations join in sympathy strikes a total of  miners could be on strike he said
gold and coal account for more than half of south africas foreigncurrency earnings
the unions announcement produced little immediate reaction on south african financial markets where analysts said a strike had been expected and probably wouldnt have much impact unless it lasted more than a month
mine owners reportedly have been building stockpiles for several weeks in anticipation of a strike
mining companies shares rose along with the price of gold but the metals rise came mainly in reaction to increased tensions in the persian gulf
the south african rand was slightly firmer
mr ramaphosa said the union is demanding a  acrosstheboard wage increase for black miners who the union says earn an average of  rand  a month
the chamber of mines which represents the nations six biggest mining houses says black miners earn about twice that much
it implemented wage increases ranging from  to  last month
anglo american corp the huge south african mining house warned against a strike saying miners had received a good wage increase in july and wouldnt gain further raises by a job action
but at this stage it seems the strike seems inevitable said mr ramaphosa who added that there hadnt been any negotiations with management since a strike ballot received overwhelming support during the week of july 
he also warned of possible confrontations with police saying we have issued instructions to our members that if they are attacked they should defend themselves
miners strikes in recent years have featured clashes with police leaving dozens of people dead
the total mines that will be affected are  gold mines around the country and  collieries the union official said
our union is at the same time in dispute with a number of other companies where strike action could take place at any time should the various mine managements refuse to accede to our members demands
he said such other companies included de beers consolidated mines ltd the worlds largest diamond miner
in addition to the general wage increase mr ramaphosa said the union is demanding pay for black miners doing dangerous work
the black miners also are asking for  days leave each year and a paid holiday on june  the anniversary of the  soweto riots
they also want an increase in death benefits to five years from two
discoverys astronauts overcame balky equipment to send the hubble space telescope floating free from the shuttle today on a year quest for secrets of the universe
the  billion telescope began orbiting earth every  minutes at an altitude of  miles  high above the atmosphere which has limited the view of groundbased telecopes
discovery go for hubble release mission control told the crew at  pm edt
the event occurred a minute later as the shuttle slowly and carefully backed away
the final hours before its release were a nightmare for ground controllers as they commanded the unfurling of two solar panels that power the telescopes instruments
the starboard panel balked twice as it was being pulled from its reel
mission control ordered spacewalking astronauts to be ready to go out of the cabin to help
but there was a third try and it was successful
we have confirmation that the solar array wing on the starboard side has been deployed the telescope control center in maryland said
so we have good news said dave drachlis of the hubble control center
the deployment of the two foot panels allowed sun power to flow into the telescopes batteries relieving worries that they would use up their eighthour charge
before astronaut steve hawley was able to lift the ton telescope from the cargo bay with the shuttles mechanical arm its instruments had to be disconnected from the shuttles power and shifted over to the batteries
precisely one day after lifting off from launch pad b at kennedy space center the hubble space telescope is ready to fly on its own mission controls jeffrey carr said
the game has begun
the race is on
the clock is ticking
astronauts kathryn sullivan and bruce mccandless put on spacesuits and entered an airlock in order to be ready to walk outside and pull out the array had mechanical deployment of the solar panels failed
cameras aboard discovery showed the telescope being held at the end of a foot crane reflecting sunlight from its silver surface and a turning earth in the background
earlier this morning discovery commander loren j shriver maneuvered the shuttle into its deployment position with its nose pointed toward the sun
that was to put the telescopes solar arrays once unfurled at the proper angle to quickly start collecting energy and protect the telescopes fixed star trackers while the instrument was being held above the payload bay
discovery is in orbit  miles above earth  miles higher than any previous shuttle
the orbit was dictated by the need to put the telescope above the earths distorting atmosphere
for those technically inclined this morning id like to pass on the quote of the day from the onboard astronomer hawley something to the effect that the big marble sure looks far away today shriver said
the five astronauts busy day began on a musical note early this morning as mission control played a song called space is our world written by members of discoverys training team and a houstonarea group private numbers
controllers monitoring the telescope at goddard space flight center in maryland said tuesday that no problems had been detected so far aboard hubble the most expensive and complex unmanned spacecraft ever built
everything has just being going like clockwork said ron schlagheck shift director of orbital verifications at goddard
everybody is in excellent spirits
the hubble telescope delayed by technical problems and the  challenger accident has waited seven years to take its place in space
it finally got a ride into orbit tuesday morning aboard discovery
hubble will allow astronomers to study stars and galaxies so distant their light has taken  billion years to reach earth
it is expected to provide clues to the age and size of the universe and it may solve the mysteries of quasars pulsars and black holes and even find stars with planets that could conceivably support life
the pound telescope is  feet long and  feet in diameter about the size of a railroad tank car
when it is in orbit it will receive electrical power for its six scientific instruments from two winglike solar arrays
it is named for the late astronomer edwin p hubble whose discovery during the s that the universe is expanding gave rise to the big bang theory that the universe was created by a tremendous explosion  billion to  billion years ago
the space shuttle discovery brought a thundering end to years of frustration when it blasted off tuesday to extend human vision to the very edge of the universe
the discovery roared to a record high orbit of  miles where its crew today will eversocarefully deploy the hubble space telescope billed as the finest optical instrument ever created a billion scope that is half a billion times more powerful than the human eye
seven years behind schedule the telescope will be deployed by astronaut steven hawley an astronomer on a day that many scientists were beginning to doubt they would ever see
its been long and frustrating conceded edward weiler program scientist for the national aeronautics and space administration who was visibly shaken by the launch
every astronomer he said softly should take today off
the launch marked the beginning of an era  some say a revolution  in the exploration of the universe
after  years astronomer eric chaisson of the space telescope science institute said with a sigh it has finally left the earth
high above the haze of the earths atmosphere the hubble is expected to produce images  times sharper than even the largest telescopes on earth today
the telescope will not get down to serious science until it completes a sevenmonth checkout and engineering period
then scientists will begin studying some of the dimmest and most distant objects in the universe
after the deployment engineers at the goddard space flight center will begin the tedious process of activating the telescope
although scientific images that should tell much about the origin and evolution of the universe will not be released for several months there will be a few teasers early on
in about seven days the hubble should snap its first picture  what astronomers call first light for the telescope  but it will be primarily an engineering exercise and the image is not expected to amount to much
the image of a cluster of stars in the southern sky will be taken during the beginning of the focusing phase so it may not even be in focus
but it will still represent a historic moment
the stars may be so out of focus they look like doughnuts said caltechs james westphal principal scientist for the telescopes wide field camera
but however it comes out its going to be great
it will mark the moment when humans freed themselves from the fuzzy view from earth and looked to the heavens with absolute clarity
there will be other space telescopes in the years ahead but there will never be another moment quite like this
every bit of  years was worth it weiler said moments after discovery lifted off on a sunny day pierced a fleecy white cloud and emerged on the other side like a spacecraft on a journey to the future
sadly some who have worked so hard for so long were forced to miss the launch
they were here two weeks ago but when the launch was delayed because of a hydraulic problem they returned to their homes and many agencies had not budgeted for two trips to cape canaveral
weiler estimated that only about onethird of the people who were here april  made it back for tuesdays launch
among the missing were most of the families who had accompanied scientists in hopes of seeing this little bit of history
there was only one small snag in the otherwise perfect launch when a valve failed to close automatically halting the countdown at  seconds before launch
the valve was ordered by computer to correct its position and it did so clearing the way for the countdown to resume
that delayed the launch about four minutes
but at  am pdt with air force col loren j shriver  sitting in the commanders seat the shuttle lifted off
all five members of the crew are veterans of previous flights
this is the second flight for charles f bolden jr  the pilot and mission specialists bruce mccandless  and kathryn d sullivan 
it is the third flight for hawley 
sullivan and mccandless will be partially suited for a spacewalk today just in case anything goes wrong during the deployment of the telescope
the most anxious moments will come as hawley gently lifts the pound instrument out of its tight quarters in the cargo bay
he will do that with the shuttles robotic arm which he tested in the first hours of the flight
the arm however tends to drift slightly so he will have his hands full keeping the telescope from banging into the sides of the payload bay as he lifts it
engineers will not breathe freely until the telescopes two giant solar arrays are unfurled
the solar arrays keep the telescopes hightech batteries charged and if they are not fully deployed within six hours after the telescope is lifted out of the cargo bay the batteries will have discharged to the point that some instruments in the telescope could be damaged
so sullivan and mccandless will be ready to step outside and manually unfurl the solar arrays if necessary
after the telescope is released and functioning on its own the discovery will back off about  miles and shepherd the scope around earth for two days
if anything goes wrong during that period the shuttle can rendezvous with the telescope and mccandless and sullivan can go out and work on the problem
if there are no problems discovery will land at  am pdt sunday at edwards air force base
in what amounted to a public apology mikhail s gorbachev and soviet leaders today eulogized andrei d sakharov as a man of honesty and sincerity who suffered great injustice at the hands of previous rulers
an obituary signed by gorbachev five other members of the ruling communist party politburo and  other leading officials and scholars was printed along with a picture of sakharov on page  of the party daily pravda
such obituaries are reserved for favored public figures and scientists and pravda emphasized the importance of the  nobel peace prize winner by printing a decree about the formation of a funeral commission in a black box on its front page
sakharov  died thursday night in his study just hours after urging fellow members of the congress of peoples deputies to create a formal opposition to the party in their drive to break its sevendecade strangehold on political power
a distinguished scientist and public figure a man of honesty and sincerity has passed away the obituary said
everything that andrei dmitrievich did was dictated by his conscience his deep humanitarian convictions
the obituary noted sakharov was exiled in the industrial city of gorky about  miles east of moscow from  to 
gross injustices were permitted in relation to ad sakharov it said
it was signed by gorbachev and fellow politburo members nikolai i ryzhkov vadim a medvedev lev n zaikov alexander n yakovlev and vitaly i vorotnikov
however the signatures of several other politburo members including kgb chief vladimir a kryuchkov and leading conservative yegor k ligachev were missing
absence of their signatures could signify that the disagreed with part of the obituary
ligachev interviewed by the tass news agency on friday had said he disagreed with sakharov but respected him
it was leonid i brezhnev now blamed by gorbachev for permitting stagnation and corruption to overcome the soviet system who exiled sakharov for criticizing the soviet intervention in afghanistan
gorbachev called sakharov in gorky in december  and told him he could return to moscow
the soviet leader told reporters at the congress of peoples deputies that sakharovs death was a great loss
even though the two often tangled at the congress gorbachev said he respected sakharov
he was not some sort of political intriguer the soviet president said friday
gorbachev said he would attend sakharovs funeral monday afternoon in southwest moscows vostryakovskoye cemetery
several hundred people gathered outside sakharovs apartment building friday evening holding candles and wreathing his photograph in flowers
memorial services were scheduled sunday at the citys main youth center and on monday at the lebedev physics institute where sakharov worked and the academy of sciences of which he was a leading member
the popular nighttime tv program vzglad showed a brief interview with his widow yelena bonner discussing the funeral arrangements
the obituary also praised sakharovs vision as a scientist which made him the youngestever member of the academy of sciences at age  and led to his inclusion in a group that developed the soviet hydrogen bomb
but it said that sakharov realized the danger of the weapon he had helped create
working on the creation of weapons of mass destruction ad sakharov understood early the danger for humanity of their wide production and testing and stubbornly placed before the government the question of limiting such tests it said
but at that time his appeals were not accepted it said
he kept these same positions in the future
the death of emperor hirohito finished the list of political and military leaders of the world war ii era one of the darkest and bloodiest eras of history on either the european or asian continents
the political and military role that emperor hirohito played before and during the war was never clear to us
he may not have had that kind of influence now but before the war he was regarded as god and was worshiped in japan with religious vigor
at the surrender of the imperial japanese government hirohito was spared punishment because it was his ambitious military generals who made the decision to invade the neighbors
i found it is very hard to believe that a man in his middle age in his position in his culture and in his country at that time had nothing much to do with all the military aggravations that his armies imposed on neighboring countries
of course some japanese military leaders were executed after the war for criminal acts they were responsible for
i often wonder if hirohito ever felt grateful to those generals who were sacrificed in part so that he could live for another  years
i only wish that the soul of emperor hirohito be ready to face the ultimate justice when he meets with the waiting souls of millions of innocent men women and children who were tortured and murdered in his name during the war

greek divers have plunged  feet beneath the aegean sea and back into history finding a treasureladen turkish warship sunk by greek revolutionaries in 
the remains of the wooden sailing ship were found near the island of chios in the eastern aegean at a point where historical accounts place the sinking of the ottoman ship according to peter nicolaides a diver and salvage expert
the bourloti seimaz  or explosives invincible  was set afire and sunk by greek admiral constantine kanaris in revenge for turkish killing and looting on chios
thousands of islanders died in the turkish raids which shocked other nations and swung western european countries behind the greek struggle for independence from the ottoman empire
greece won independence in 
the french painter eugene delacroix produced a famous picture the massacre of chios based on the raids
its an incredible discovery straight out of the history book we used to read in school about the war of independence nicolaides said in an interview friday with the associated press
nicolaides who heard about the wreck while teaching an underwater archaeology course to local divers last winter started querying fishermen about where their nets snagged on seabed obstacles
he pinpointed the wreck on may  he said
when i dived i found ships timbers sticking out of the muddy seabed and dozens of objects  islamic cooking pots cannon balls a candlestick even a chalice from a greek orthodox church he said
the ship was obviously crammed with loot from chios
i think there may be gold and silver items as well he said
i also saw what i recognized as human bones he added
he said the wreckage indicated the vessel was at least  feet in length
according to historians more than  people  including  greek captives  were aboard the ship when kanaris staged his attack in the early hours of june  
the greek admiral sailed from the nearby island of psara towing a boat stuffed with explosives
its pointed bow was rammed into the mouth of a cannon on the bourloti seimaz and a fuse lit
the ottoman commander admiral kara ali was killed in the blast that split the ship
kanaris and his crew of greeks escaped
this is a very significant very emotive find coming from this particular period of history said george papathanassopoulos the culture ministrys adviser on marine archaeology
papathanassopoulos said the foot water depth at the site will make investigation difficult since underwater archaeology rarely is attempted at depths over  feet but he said this is a ship that must be explored
nicolaides said he hoped it would be possible to tap american and turkish expertise to excavate the wreck as an international project
american experts from the institute of nautical archaeology at texas a  m university working in cooperation with turkish divers have pioneered underwater excavation off the turkish aegean coast
greek marine archaeologists focus on locating and surveying historic wrecks scattered around the aegean and rarely carry out excavations
their common ground pretty much ended when the miles of asphalt to the finish line did
by the time most people were starting their first cup of coffee sunday morning benjamin paredez martinez of ecatepec mexico and kathy smith of newport beach were crowned winners in the san diego marathon at the oceanside pier efforts than earned them  apiece
the runs set records on the new north county course but the times even helped by warm breezes and clear degree conditions were hardly blistering
martinez  finished in  hours  minutes  seconds  seconds faster than doug kurtis of northville mich smiths  seemed days quicker than the  posted by escondidos mindy ireland
in years past the marathons mystery often has been who the leader was not how he got there
runners often from mexico would register late and race officials were at their wits end when the media screamed to know the identity of the leader
this year officials made sure there were no mystery men out on the course
they knew who martinez was but no one was sure how he was able to practically appear out of nowhere to take the lead from alfredo rosas of san pedro going into the mile mark
what martinez did was start out slow and deliberate
through an interpreter martinez said he started out running  or  miles
rosas and a pack of as many as eight came out at a pace seven to  seconds quicker per mile
i knew it would kill them that they would never keep it up said martinez who won with a mile pace
i had to have patience and run from the back
after the mile mark the pack has already thinned to just rosas danny bustos doug kurtis and ernesto gutierrez who ran single file for a time
martinez and martin rodriguez rivera held back but martinez soon heard a little voice that told him to move or be removed from contention
the first  miles i could have been in th place martinez said
i didnt care
then i got worried
martinez left rivera and started on the chase
since martinez hadnt been seen earlier it originally was thought the figure gainly ground slowly but methodically from mile  to mile  was san diegos henry chio
wrong
martinez late kick caught rosas who had broken away on his own for a threemile lead at mile  cramped and been surprised at the mile mark
i tied up there was nothing i could do said rosas who was third in 
as he started closing thats when my legs really started getting sore
i tried to just hang on to hang in there but he shot ahead of me
before martinez took the lead for good  a uphill surge at mile   it appeared rosas was hearing footsteps and was looking over his shoulder to see who was gaining on him
not so said rosas
the police on the bikes were telling me how close he was he said
it was the second marathon in two weeks that kurtis  has run and almost won
the bangkok marathon in november was his th of the year his th to date
the only recurring theme in martinez and smiths backgrounds  other than the  miles they ran  was that they are novices at longdistance running this was their first victory at this distance and that they are both teachers
martinez is a worldclass biathlete who finished third at the world duathlon championship two weeks ago near palm springs
he has run only two marathons before sunday
he teaches physical education in his hometown  miles outside of mexico city
smith  was a  and meter specialist at stanford but is now focusing on longer distances
she is a fourth through sixthgrade teacher at college park in irvine
she was holding class with reporters long before ireland  was carried into a room for mandatory drug testing  the united states olympic committee drug testing program randomly selected this race to administer tests to the top finishers
my goal was to come out here be as lowkey as possible and try to qualify for the trials said smith who finished fourth last year and ran a personalbest time sunday
she met and beat the olympic trials qualifying standard of 
smith said she and ireland ran together  they even chatted  through the mile mark until smith got her feet working faster than her mouth
having run with ireland last year in the san diego marathon smith knew a little of irelands racing style
shes really tough in the latter part of a race smith said
i wanted to hang back with her so then she could carry me through the latter part
she hung in pretty well with me
smith earlier this year ran the long beach marathon where she finished seventh but has been concentrating on this distance for just a year
she is getting smarter about it
last year i led from miles  to  smith said
this years its just a matter of maturity
and the hills were positive for me
martinez said entered this event because he knew the field was weak and his chances were good
i knew rosas and kurtis were good but it was a relatively weak field he said
but weak field or not the plus runners who participated in the event seemed to relish the experience as all the problems the marathon has had to deal with faded as each runner crossed the finish line
its a beautiful course and this was a great marathon one runner told race director lynn flanagan
i cant believe it went off so well said another to a volunteer
youd never know anything had happened that was at all an inconvenience

leading national parties decided wednesday to send a highpowered delegation to srinagar according to the press trust of india news agency

jagmohan said the truck was driving around srinagar distributing food to troops on street corners when it was blown up by moslem militants
he gave no further details of the attack
the attacks came amid government claims that security forces arrested at least  leaders of the moslem group hezbul mujahedeen
jagmohan said the militants from srinagar and the border towns of baramulla and kupwara have been arrested since sunday
hezbul mujahedeen is one of  militant groups fighting for secession
it is believed the second most powerful independence group after the jammukashmir liberation front
we are going to hit hard at antinational elements there is no way they can get away with what they are doing jagmohan said
it may take a month six months maybe a year but ultimately these antinational elments are going to be neutralized
jagmohan a hindu was appointed the state governor of jammukashmir on jan  in an attempt by the government to control the unrest
kashmir has been a problem for more than four decades following the  partition of british colonial india into predominantly moslem pakistan and the mostly hindu india
jammukashmir then a princely state chose to merge with india
pakistan protested claiming the territory because of its predominantly moslem population
the two countries have twice gone to war over the territory
the kashmir portion of jammukashmir is mostly moslem while the southern jammu segment is predominantly hindu
overall about  percent of the states  million people are moslem
nationwide moslems make up  percent of indias  million people and hindus account for  percent
president bush has decided to nominate john d negroponte a veteran diplomat who helped direct us aid to nicaraguan rebels to the key position of ambassador to mexico administration officials said thursday
negroponte a year foreign service veteran served as us ambassador to honduras from  through  when the cia was secretly funding the contras
mexicos leftist opposition party already has criticized the appointment which has not been formally announced
but bush administration officials said they are confident that the mexican government of president carlos salinas de gortari will accept the nomination
can reject nomination under diplomatic practice the white house notifies other governments in advance of its choices for ambassadors
the foreign government can reject the nomination but rejection would be considered an unusual diplomatic slap
meanwhile bushs choice as assistant secretary of state for latin america democratic political consultant bernard aronson ran into objections from several republican members of the senate foreign relations committee congressional aides said
the two senior republicans on the panel sens
jesse helms rn c and richard g lugar rind
 both expressed concern about aronsons appointment to secretary of state james a baker iii the aides said
helms questioned the appointment of a democrat to the post and lugar expressed concern that aronson had no experience with the economic issues facing south america they said
the aides said it appears unlikely that the senators will attempt to block aronsons nomination but that the former aide to president jimmy carter will face tough questioning in his confirmation hearings
negroponte created controversy in honduras as a vigorous proponent of the thensecret contra effort and honduran opposition leaders who said he acted as though he were the governor of a colony dubbed him washingtons proconsul in the country
but he later concluded that it had been a mistake for the ronald reagan administration to aid the rebels secretly without building more public support for its policy in central america associates said
negroponte was most recently a deputy to lt gen colin l powell president reagans last national security adviser and had been an aide to henry a kissinger then national security adviser to president richard m nixon during the vietnam war in 
he has also worked on negotiations with mexico on environmental and tunafishing issues
hes one of the smartest operators in the business a former aide said
hes very good at working the bureaucracy
state department officials said that they had expected mexican leftists to register complaints about the appointment because of negropontes support of the contras but that they are confident that salinas government will not object formally
they will blow a little steam off in the press but i dont think the mexican government would dream of rejecting him one official said
they dont want to get relations with the bush administration off on that footing
negroponte  will succeed charles pilliod an ohio industrialist

when the doors swung open wednesday at the first mcdonalds restaurant in the soviet union thousands of muscovites poured in to sip milk cocktails and taste their first beeg mak gamburgers picking them apart to marvel at the fixins
some expressed wonder at the speedy service  only an hour in line  while others heralded the event as the first evidence that president mikhail s gorbachevs economic reforms are finally filtering down to the average muscovite
although cynics might complain of the steady homogenizing of world cultures the arrival of the fastfood chain here   years after a canadian mcdonalds official broached the idea with soviet officials at the  montreal olympics  was without doubt a major event
most customers seemed thrilled to be part of it even though some of them gave the big mac sandwich a mixed review
it tasted very i would say unusual lubov sereda  said with a smile
everything was very soft and mild
but those strawberry milk cocktails well
 her husband put in flashing a thumbsup sign
it was very interesting that gamburger zvetlana generotova  said leaving with a large paper bag filled with takeout food also a new concept here
i certainly want my family to try it at least once
russians say gamburger because they pronounce western words that begin with h as though they begin with g another customer victor kunyasev said well my wife makes better food
but it was nice a good place to take a break and grab a bite to eat
some reported waiting up to  hour and  minutes to be served but most did not seem to mind
in honor of the grand opening a brigade of workers distributed mcdonalds flags and pins entertainers performed on the accordion and sang folk songs under golden arches adorned with the soviet hammer and sickle
the worlds largest mcdonalds with  cash registers and a seating capacity of  brings to moscow not only hamburgers french fries and shakes called milk cocktails here but also a living lesson in westernstyle marketing
at training sessions before opening day cashiers were taught the importance of greeting customers cheerfully of saying please and thank you  all of which promises something distinctly different from the typically surly service at most of moscows dingy state cafes
this is very different from anything ive ever done before cashier larissa lebedeva said
lebedeva  who formerly worked as deputy director of a small food store said that to be this polite and to have everything this clean is new for the workers as well as for the customers
sam yahel from mcdonalds in atlanta who helped train the  soviet workers said the soviet trainees were at a disadvantage because in most other parts of the world new workers had at least eaten at one of the restaurants
most of the soviet workers had never tasted a westernstyle hamburger
they practiced cooking using yellow cardboard squares in place of cheese and different colored poker chips in place of onions tomatoes and pickles
the soviet union is definitely a different world yahel said
our food and our standards  its all new
for example we had to teach our employees that when there were still crumbs on the counter it needed to be wiped off again
while most of the soviet workers trained for a matter of days the four soviet managers of the restaurant spent nine months abroad learning their jobs
they graduated from the canadian institute of hamburgerology
the moscow mcdonalds will be open for  hours a day beginning at  am and will be able they say to serve more than  customers a day
on wednesday though it stayed open an extra two hours and served a mcdonalds record  meals
the previous record for openingday transactions was  in budapest hungary and the previous record sales for a single day was  in hong kong
there is a brass plaque near the entrance that announces soviet rubles only
virtually every other foreign firm that has come into the soviet union in recent years accepts only hard currencies meaning that it caters primarily to foreigners
the mcdonalds prices are high compared to the state restaurants where a large meal seldom costs more than a ruble
the big mac costs  rubles or about  at the official exchange rate and dinner out for the family can come to two days wages for the average soviet worker
mcdonalds employees are paid  rubles an hour with a chance for an increase of up to  kopecks in three months time
the staff was chosen from  applicants
canadian and american officials who have helped train the soviet personnel know that the allure of working for a western firm was a drawing factor but they nonetheless expect a  turnover rate twice their normal average
mcdonalds invested  million in setting up the restaurant and a food processing plant in a moscow suburb that turns out everything from meat patties to sesameseed buns
soviet farmers who are supplying most of the products have been given special training and diseaseresistant seed for potatoes and cucumbers
the extra effort was necessary to guarantee supplies in a country where as much as  of the harvest spoils on the way to the consumer
despite all of the planning some shortages still affect the operation
coffee is not on the menu for example because supplies cannot be guaranteed
the joint venture agreement between mcdonalds of canada and the moscow city council calls for  restaurants though there is no timetable or even a definite plan for when or where the second mcdonalds will open
is there any fear that when the golden arches become as common as the cupolas of russian orthodox churches it will be a sign that capitalism is making real inroads in the communist capital
mcdonalds officials say it is not a question that worries them or their soviet counterparts
there werent many ideological discussions during these negotiations said marc winer  a native of nashua nh who is general director of the moscow outlet
the soviets understood that the food was going to move very efficiently from the field to the mouth
that is more important to them right now than almost anything else
gone from tiananmen square are the prodemocracy banners and the tents of chinas freedom movement replaced by tanks armed guards and the chants of drilling soldiers
the army on thursday allowed the people of beijing their first glance of the acre expanse since the military swept into the capital six days ago leaving hundreds dead and crushing a movement for political change
troops moved back their barricades making it possible for city residents to walk to the edge of the square which for seven weeks stood at the heart of the movement
buses and bicyclists today were allowed to pass by changan avenue which borders the north edge of the square
the spot once occupied by the goddess of democracy a foothigh replica of the statue of liberty was taken by a treadwheeled armored personnel carrier
when students built the statue last week for a few days it became a symbol of the movement for democratic reforms and an end to official corruption
on sunday morning a tank crushed it
in all  tanks and  armored personnel carriers lined the northern part of the square
the monument to revolutionary martyrs where the students took a final stand early sunday was swept clean
poems and posters calling for a more open china have disappeared from its sides
chinese red cross officials estimate  people were killed and  injured over the weekend citing a chinese students organization the union of chinese students in west germany
the government says nearly  people mostly soldiers were killed diplomats and chinese say up to  died
soldiers drilled in tiananmens center their cadenced shouting echoing around the vast expanse
a crowd of officials stood on the roof of the great hall of the people overlooking the square
from this same roof five days earlier officials watched as a jubilant mass of demonstrators enveloped  troops and blocked their entry to the square
inside the square soldiers could be seen shuffling about their uniformed jackets stripped off wash basins in hand
there was a relaxed air of the inside of an army barracks as unarmed troops carried food and walked slowly together talking and laughing in groups
the area once housing students tents has become a holding area for a huge fleet of troop trucks
on the southern perimeter a single line of tanks and a cordon of soldiers blocked the square from the thousands of bicylists who pedaled slowly by peering into tiananmen
near the square troops placed barbed wire in front of one street
soldiers were billeted in a construction site their laundered fatigues drying on the scaffolding
next door troops their assault rifles slung nonchalantly over their shoulders stood and chatted outside a discotheque
they look like they  said one local resident
i hope they know that we still dont want them here
the earthquake that struck northern iran brought reminders of another quake that devastated soviet armenia in 
like thursdays earthquake in iran the dec   earthquake in armenia killed about  people
most died in structures that collapsed when the quake hit
its very similar to what we had in armenia said russ needham a geophysicist with the us geological survey
the armenian quake was measured at  on the richter scale but thursdays earthquake shook the earth with a magnitude of  according to the us geological survey
in the iranian quake the casualty count was pushed up by the fact that people were indoors and asleep at the time just after midnight
many of the victims lived in fragile homes built of a ceramictype brick or adobe that collapses easily
in the armenian quake a soviet parliamentary report later blamed the high number of fatalities on shoddily built buildings
most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something falling on top of you said needham in a telephone interview from golden colo
the quake struck an area of iran where most of the buildings are built on a flood plain of loosely deposited soil that shifts in an earthquake and allows structures to collapse needham said
the magnitude quake was the largest ever recorded in that area where two major plates of the earths crust meet he said
iran is in a very active seismic region he said and that there have been many smaller quakes
twelve earthquakes greater than magnitude  have occurred in iran during the last  years needham said
a quake of magnitude  is considered a major earthquake capable of widespread heavy damage in populated areas
investigators were looking into complaints from some survivors that the crew abandoned the ferry without helping passengers and that some crew members pushed aside passengers to get to lifeboats

they left us with women and kids who died
 hassan said the ship sank within  minutes of hitting the reef
during that time he said he saw no crew members helping passengers
 the crew told us to stand on one side
they wore life preservers and left us and even pushed us aside to escape he said
they could have had time to help
 many survivors spent hours in sharkinfested waters or in lifeboats before being picked up
egypts director of port security hassan alaghouri said the rescue was delayed by the storm
 at safaga central hospital mustafa ahmed  said he pulled  people into a lifeboat

i managed to get  people who were around me in the sea onto the boat
we waited until a ship rescued us at around noon
 prime minister atef sidki who traveled to safaga said many passengers may have been on lifeboats driven far from the wreckage by strong winds
 however many bodies were expected to be found in the hull of the ferry
efforts to lift it began today
 us navy helicopter crews reported lots of wreckage including life preservers rafts and floating material where the ferry went down
they said the ton ferry lay on its starboard  or righthand  side with its port side protruding from the water

nesbitt said wednesdays ton shipment flown free from portland ore by united parcel service will be sold to farmers on monday
heavy rain fell on some of the driest areas of central and eastcentral minnesota but it was way way below what we should have as far as precipitation goes a national weather service hydrologist said
we need  a widespread distribution over a long period of time say maybe  inches of rainfall to get us back to what we normally should be gary mcdevitt said
it was the heaviest rainfall for the eastcentral part of the state since april  when the area got about a halfinch of rain
weather experts say mississippi could see above normal rainfall in the coming week
rainfall during the week ending wednesday averaged  inch in some areas with some extreme northern counties receiving greater amounts
but the weather service said all mississippi farm communities still had only  percent to  percent of normal moisture
road builders in the kansas city area say the effects of dry weather in the midwest this year are not all bad
engineers say several highway projects in the area will be open to traffic at least a month earlier than expected because of fewer interruptions caused by rain and wet weather
 as many as  fires sparked by lightning from thunderstorms have blackened about  acres in the custer national forest
the fires are being fought by from  to  firefighters
a lightningcaused fire in the bob marshall wilderness area of northwest montana was being allowed to burn naturally officials said
state agriculture director roy frederick said nebraska farmers probably will have better crops than are expected nationwide and may benefit from higher prices
nebraskas outlook for the corn crop is rosier than national predictions because  percent of the corn comes from irrigated acres and nebraska has received more rain than some other states he said

the volcano about  miles west of the air base came to life last week after six centuries of dormancy
no casualties have been reported but experts are concerned that a major eruption could occur soon
 gases ash and molten rock continued to pour out of the mountain today enshrouding it in thick gray clouds of ash and steam that rose  feet
 the philippine institute of vulcanology and seismology said it detected rhythmic ground movements today that indicated molten material was rising to the surface of the craters
 institute director raymundo punongbayan said mount pinatubo was in the early eruptive stage and after that we will have bigger ones
 he said most of the ash and molten rocks had been flowing westward away from clark
but he said geological studies showed that in the previous eruption  years ago the main flow cut across what is now the western portion of clark
 rains fell across the area sunday night and officials warned residents in the lush green lowlands west of the mountain to move to higher ground to escape mud flows
 air force spokesman lt col ron rand announced the evacuation in a  am broadcast over the us militarys far east network
an hour later the first vehicles began rolling out of clark for the usrun subic bay naval base where the  troops dependents and civilian employees will be housed until the danger passes
another  troops remained at clark to provide security
 the clark command center operated with a skeletal crew but the bases operations were suspended
the base is a major terminal for the worldwide network of flights operated by the military airlift command

 in southern japan today mount unzen continued to shake and spew hot ash and rocks and heavy rain was falling on the tons of ash and rock it disgorged over the past week raising fears of deadly mudslides
 areas around the foot volcano covered by evacuation warnings were expanded to protect people against possible slides of volcanic debris that could be triggered by the rain police said
 an explosion of superheated gas ashes and rocks from the mountain one week ago claimed  lives and a larger flow over the weekend razed dozens more homes
in all about  people have been evacuated from communities at the foot of the mountain said police in nagasaki  miles away
 mount unzen and mount pinatubo belong to the ring of fire that circles the pacific where shifting plates of the earths crust push against each other triggering periodic volcanic eruptions and earthquakes
 in the philippines officials have evacuated more than  people in three provinces since mount pinatubo began erupting last week
about  of them are primitive aeta tribes people who lived on pinatubos slopes
 many of them walked or traveled by ox cart to flee the volcano
but reporters found that some evacuees are returning to their homes each morning to tend to livestock and crops and heading back to evacuation centers at sundown
 punongbayan said he flew to the area and warned people there would be no time to escape once a major eruption begins
 there was no indication how long the americans evacuated from clark would stay at subic but they were ordered to take along important papers and food water and clothing for three days
 subic base spokesman bob coble said families at the naval installation had been asked to take in evacuees and that others would double up in bachelor officer and enlisted quarters
 mount pinatubo which last had a major eruption in  began to show signs of activity in april
last week it belched small amounts of steam and ash
 there are about  active and  dormant volcanoes in the philippines
the last major eruption occurred in  when the taal volcano about  miles south of manila exploded
about  people were killed
the major earthquake that struck the san francisco bay area tuesday occurred in a region seismologists targeted as having the highest probability of a strong quake in northern california
a  report by the us geological survey placed the probability of an earthquake of  magnitude on the richter scale at  percent by the year  in the southern santa cruz mountains
the high probability is based on several factors including length of time since the last major earthquake struck the area in  said clarence allen professor of geology and geophysics at the california institue of technology in pasadena
this is not to say we predicted the earthquake
it just has to do with the probability of an earthquake in this area allen said
he noted that the  report titled probabilities of large earthquakes occurring in california on the san andreas fault presented information that was already widely known among scientists
allen said this information should have alerted officials to take preventive steps
frank baldwin of us geological surveys earthquake center said the quakes magnitude was  on the richter scale
it was centered in the santa cruz calif area  miles south of san francico
the richter scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs
a reading of  can cause severe damage
a quake of  magnitude a major earthquake is capable of widespread heavy damage
initial reports indicated widespread damage from tuesdays quake especially affecting highways and old masonry buildings
its not like an earthquake of this size in this area is a calamitous event
its something we should therefore be ready for allen said
the damage in the bay area occurred to the same kind of structures heavily damaged in the  whittier quake in the los angeles area which registered a  richter reading allen said
i think well learn a lot from an engineering point of view from this earthquake he said
what will be important is to see how the modern structures behaved
allen said many of the same kinds of older structures that appeared to have been damaged in san francisco also exist in the los angeles region
in addition some of the roadways and overpasses in the area have roughly the same kind of construction as the bay bridge
in some areas of southern california there is a higher probability of a major quake occurring
the highest the usgs says is in the central california town of parkfield where there is a  percent probability of a magnitude  earthquake by the year

cbs estimates that  million viewers saw all or part of the game down only  million from last year despite the fact that this years match was a blowout
on the upside for cbs  super bowl xxiv carried enough of its audience over to the debut of the new series grand slam to provide a good audience sampling and give the action show a ranking of th for the night

first accounts of the accident were reported sunday in kenyan newspapers
two englishlanguage dailies said the accident occurred one mile off the coast but a third said it was six miles away
 police navy divers tourists and local residents had recovered about  bodies by saturday afternoon but  victims were believed still trapped in the sunken vessel according to the newspapers
 confirmation from local authorities of the accounts was not immediately available
 the boat with the refugees had set sail from the somali town of kismayo  miles north of malindi on feb  it was one of a stream of vessels that brought thousands of somalis seeking refuge to kenya since rebels overthrew somalian president mohamed siad barre in late january
the victory followed a month of heavy fighting in mogadishu capital of the east african nation
 the fighting appears largely to have stopped since the rebel united somali congress established an interim government but refugees continue to arrive in kenya
 abdi mohammed ali a survivor was quoted as telling the standard newspaper that most of those who drowned were on the ships lower deck
 first word of the accident came when two survivors staggered into the jambo club tourist hotel manager barney ngare was quoted as saying by the sunday nation
 the hotel sent a small boat to help save those still on the sinking vessel but rescue workers had to cut the lifeline when too many people grabbed hold according to ngare
 another boat sent by the hotel ferried  people at a time to shore said the nation
 eleven somalis drowned when a boat capsized off kenya near lamu north of malindi on feb 
more than  people were feared drowned after an overcrowded ferry sank at a river junction in southern bangladesh police said today
fifteen bodies were recovered and  people were reported missing in the sinking wednesday night where the ilisha and tetulia rivers meet and join the meghna police and a district administrator said

the los angeles sports council in a bid to bring super bowl xxvii to the rose bowl in  will offer the stadium to the national football league rentfree in a proposal next monday
the sports council which represents the los angelesorange county area in trying to bring major sports attractions here also will offer the nfl all income from concessions and the sale of novelty items
competing against the rose bowl are san diego san francisco and phoenix
because the rose bowl has  seats the council selected it as the prime venue
under a joint agreement the coliseum and anaheim stadium did not submit competing bids but they would share in the revenues if pasadena gets the game said ed aghjayan pasadenas deputy city manager
the bulk of the revenue would go to the rose bowl but the idea is that we would share with the coliseum and anaheim aghjayan said
details of the split are still being negotiated
one plan calls for the rose bowl to receive  of the proceeds with the two other facilities sharing 
pasadena earned  from the  super bowl and  in  the money coming from stadium rental fees concession sales admission taxes charges for use of a hospitality tent compound and parking fees
in addition the city was allowed to buy  tickets at face value for local distribution by directors and other city officials
but as bidding for the super bowl has become more competitive the nfl has taken more of the income aghjayan said in a report to the citys board of directors
in most parts of the country the stadium is offered rentfree in exchange for the benefits to local economies he said
under the proposal for the  game the city would give up most of the previous sources of revenue and allocate them to the nfl
it also would provide  square feet of space for the league to build a hospitality tent compound
the city would receive about  from seat taxes  in hotel and sales taxes arising from the event and a share of about  in parking fees
the board has approved the proposal
the rose bowl meanwhile has proposed an million project to renovate the press box and restructure about  seats for club seating with an adjacent lounge restaurant hall of fame museum and gift shop

and for the sentimentalists there will be yearold johnny kelley starting in his th boston marathon
there have only been  editions of this race run without him
 the last three boston marathons have turned into reckless speed duels
they have produced five of the top  times and eight of the top  in the races storied history
 they also have resulted in a race of attrition with many of the early speedsters burning out completely or faltering in the late stages
 along the historic route that begins in hopkinton west of boston and ends in copley square in the back bay section of the city checkpoint records have fallen at an alarming rate
 for example all  checkpoint records were shattered through the first  miles last year either by simon robert naali or juma ikangaa both of tanzania
neither won
 the winner was  olympic champion gelindo bordin who outsmarted the early pacesetters by running a patient calculating race
 running alone about  meters behind a pack of six africans bordin passed them all by  miles and went on to win in  hours  minutes  seconds the secondfastest time in the races history behind only the  by rob de castella in  ikangaa finished a distant second in 
it was his third consecutive runnerup finish in boston
 ikangaa is back again along with several other formidable africans
they include ibrahim hussein of kenya the  winner in  the thirdfastest time in boston and one second ahead of ikangaa abebe mekonnen of ethiopia the  champion in  bostons eighthbest time douglas wakiihuri of kenya the  world champion and  olympic silver medalist who is making his boston debut and naali the thirdplace finisher in the  commonwealth games
 among those chasing them will be john treacy the  olympic silver medalist and the thirdplace finisher in boston in  and  geoff smith the boston winner in  ed eyestone the topranked us marathoner salvador garcia the runnerup to wakiihuri in last years new york city marathon and rolando vera who finished third in his marathon debut in boston in  the womens division also is filled with many respectable entrants
 foremost among them are kristiansen the yearold norwegian who holds the world record of  and won in boston in  and  and samuelson  the usrecord holder at   olympic gold medalist and boston champion in  and  challenging them will be uta pippig wanda panfil and kim jones
 pippig finished second in boston last year in a careerbest 
panfil won the london marathon in  her personal best and won the new york city marathon in 
discoverys five astronauts returned sunday for a second attempt to launch the shuttle with nasas most valuable and celebrated payload the  billion hubble space telescope
discovery is scheduled to lift off at  am edt tuesday
we feel very confident that things are going to go well this time said discoverys commander air force col loren j shriver
were going to come out ok on tuesday morning and if not well just keep trying until we do
thats kind of the name of the game here shriver said
nasa test director mike leinbach said sunday that the countdown was proceeding smoothly and the shuttle appeared to be in perfect condition
the countdown got under way saturday afternoon
a faulty power unit forced the first launch attempt to be scrubbed four minutes before liftoff april 
the unit was replaced with a new one which tests showed to be fine
hopefully well get the shuttle off the pad this time leinbach said
a  percent chance of favorable weather was expected at launch time with low clouds being the main concern said the air forces ed priselac shuttle weather officer
a weak cold front from the north was expected to pass through the area by monday night
the outlook is considerably better for wednesday and thursday priselac said
as discoverys astronauts arrived from johnson space center in houston early sunday afternoon the shuttle columbia was being transported to a launch pad  miles from discovery
it is only the second time both shuttle launch pads at kennedy space center have been occupied simultaneously
the first time was in january   days after columbia lifted off challenger exploded
columbia commander vance brand said he does not believe the national aeronautics and space administration is moving too fast with his shuttle
nasa expects to launch columbia with an astronomical observatory called astro no earlier than may  one week later than planned because of discoverys twoweek delay
in some cases it could be a problem having shuttles on both launch pads brand said
in this particular case everythings fitting together
nasa has until saturday to get discovery off the ground
after that all launch attempts must be halted for eight days so hubbles batteries can be recharged
the six nickelhydrogen batteries will power hubble from the time it is disconnected from discoverys electrical system until its two energycollecting solar panels take over in space
discoverys payload bay was sealed late saturday night drastically reducing the risk of contamination to the telescopes finely polished inch mirror
discovery will aim for an altitude of  miles the highest a shuttle has ever gone so the telescope can be placed in its proper orbit far above earths distorting atmosphere
during hubbles year journey through space astronomers expect to look back to nearly the beginning of time and solve some of the universes most perplexing mysteries
astro will measure ultraviolet radiation undetected by hubble and thus provide additional targets for the telescope
the  million observatory also will focus during columbias nineday mission on comet austin believed to be on its first trip through the solar system
both hubble and astro were scheduled for launch in  but were delayed by the challenger accident
a freighter carrying a cargo of beer sank in the north sea today off the dutch coast and all nine crew members were rescued from life rafts a coast guard spokesman said
the ship sank at about  pm in high winds some  nautical miles north of the island of ameland
it was not immediately clear what had caused the sinking  miles off the dutch island of ameland according to the coast guard spokesman who was not identified
there were no casualties he said
the coast guard official who spoke in a dutch radio interview identified the ship involved as the finnishregistered freighter ra and said it had been carrying a cargo of beer
he did not give the ships origin or destination
the nine crew members boarded two life rafts after the sinking in high winds
they were taken ashore by a west german helicopter from the island of borkum about  miles from the site of the sinking the official said
a dutch navy aircraft and two life boats also rushed to the scene
earlier reports had said that the ship was a passenger ferry possibly one of the dutch ships plying the frequent ferry lanes between the coastal islands and the dutch mainland
freight shipping in the area is also heavy because of its vicinity to the ports of delfzijl in the netherlands and emden in west germany
a soviet newspaper has painted a highly sympathetic portrait of andrei d sakharov and yelena bonner countering past attacks on the dissident couple once branded as traitors by the staterun media
but the account in moscow news only indirectly mentioned the nearly seven years sakharov spent in forced internal exile for criticizing the soviet drive into afghanistan indicating that topic is still too sensitive
in its latest issue the weekly devoted its entire back page to describing the home life of sakharov  the  nobel peace prize winner and said the words most often heard in his seventhfloor moscow apartment are help me
sakharovs apartment on a major thoroughfare has been a mecca for soviets seeking his aid since he and his wife were allowed to return from exile in the closed city of gorky in december 
since then sakharov who was one of the creators of his nations hydrogen bomb has vocally supported soviet leader mikhail s gorbachevs reform campaign but has called for the liberation of all political prisoners and more improvements in the field of human rights
past soviet reports published before gorbachev became soviet leader accused bonner of marrying sakharov for his money and said the couple lived in oriental luxury amid scandals between spouses
moscow news depicted the couple as living peacefully and frugally eating cabbage beet soup potatoes and other simple fare and marveled that sakharov a member of the prestigious academy of sciences always does the dishes himself
while sakharov was in exile in the closed city of gorky the author of a book that accused him of leading a luxurious and scandalridden existence came to ask for an interview moscow news said
sakharov put a copy of his book in front of him and proposed that he write an apology for all the lies that were published the paper said
it reported that when the unidentified author refused sakharov said its too bad that duels are abolished in our times and slapped him
sakharov has been quoted numerous times by soviet media since his return from exile but the article in moscow news was the longest devoted to him so far
but most of the newspapers circulation is among foreign tourists and readers abroad so relatively few soviets would see the sakharov article
as well as appearing in russian moscow news also prints editions in english french and other languages
philippine vice president and opposition leader salvador h laurel declined saturday night to condemn the armed insurrection in his country and said the rebels have the right to try to seize power
laurel also said that the rebels will not surrender to president corazon aquinos forces as she has demanded
he predicted that the fighting may turn to civil war if reported rebel reinforcements arrive from cebu mindanao and other islands
i dont think this is going to end right away he said in a suite in the peninsula hotel here
i think its going to be a long protracted thing even civil war
although he grinned broadly and laughed often during the interview laurel denied that he was cheering for the rebels
he refused however to condemn their use of violence against a constitutionally elected government
i dont want to prejudge their goals or objectives he said
everybody should try to win with a ballot rather than a bullet he added
but democracy does not preclude that as a last resort
laurel who is known as doy broke with aquino shortly after they took office in  following a popular uprising that toppled former president ferdinand e marcos
since then laurel has criticized aquino frequently in his role as head of the opposition nacionalista party
laurel said he was in london early friday when the philippine fighting began
he flew to hong kong but was stranded here with scores of journalists because the philippines two international airports in manila and cebu have been closed since the fighting began
laurel said  nacionalista leaders were meeting at the intercontinental hotel in manila late saturday despite the presence of rebel holdouts in the hotel
he called the group his partys junta but said they have no ties to the rebels
laurel criticized aquino for asking the united states to help bolster her beleaguered forces friday
us officials have said f phantom jets flew over rebel aircraft to keep them grounded but did not drop bombs or fire
but laurel said the us fighterbombers destroyed a philippine air force fuel dump and other facilities at sangley point and fired rockets that killed civilians near camp aguinaldo the armed forces headquarters
laurel added that aquino now is completely beholden to the united states just as exploratory talks on renegotiating leases for clark air base and subic bay naval base the two largest us military facilities abroad are beginning
laurels companion homobono adaza a former member of parliament under marcos and a nacionalista member also defended the rebels
these are the reformist elements he said
they are trying to reform the government
laurel said the coup occurred because aquino failed to unite the nation or the armed forces leading to divided loyalties and fragmentation
he said she also failed to enforce the law against graft and corruption and had failed to deliver critical services
theres a power shortage he said
a rice shortage
a transport crisis
the people are fed up
theyre worse off than ever

united nations  the united states urged other un members at talks sunday to impose broad economic and military sanctions on iraq
western diplomats said the world body is expected to adopt the measures
should the un security council impose comprehensive sanctions it would be the first time since  it has taken such action against a member state
the last time such sanctions were imposed was against the white minority government of rhodesia
western diplomats said they expected up to  positive votes on the member council for sanctions against iraq
they said they expected no vetoes allowing the legally binding measure to be adopted probably on monday
they said cuba was the holdout
us
ambassador thomas r pickering told reporters after closeddoor talks sunday that the council discussed the absolute necessity of moving ahead toward a broad resolution of sanctions
he said he expected a vote monday
pickering said the united states had circulated six or seven drafts of a detailed resolution
it calls for an embargo on iraqs oil exports an embargo on imports to iraq and a halt to all arms and other military supplies for iraq
british ambassador crispen tickell told reporters later that he detected strong support with the exception of one member for action and a vote tomorrow

thousands of queuehardened soviets on wednesday cheerfully lined up to get a taste of gamburgers chizburgers and filayofeesh sandwiches as mcdonalds opened in the land of lenin for the first time
the worlds largest version of the landmark american fastfood chain rang up  meals on  cash registers breaking the openingday record for mcdonalds worldwide officials said
the soviets bundled in fur coats and hats seemed unfazed lining up before dawn outside the seat restaurant the first of  planned across the soviet union
the crush of customers was so intense the company stayed open until midnight two hours later than planned
i only waited an hour and i think they served thousands before me said a happy middleaged woman who works at an aluminum plant
and it was only  rubles for all this she said
im taking it back for the girls at the factory to try
big macs were priced at  rubles and double cheeseburgers at  rubles  about two hours pay for a starting mcdonalds staffer or the average soviet but much cheaper than other private restaurants that have sprung up recently
the official exchange rate is  per ruble but foreign visitors can buy rubles for  cents each about what the currency is worth on the black market
half the days sales were donated to the soviet childrens fund which provides medical care and assistance to orphans and disadvantaged children gary reinblatt senior vice president of mcdonalds canada said from toronto
the restaurant built by the company in a joint venture with the city of moscow that began  years ago brought to  the number of countries where mcdonalds operates
the previous openingday record for sales was in budapest company officials said
besides its restaurants in the united states the leading number of mcdonalds are in canada and japan the officials said
soviets got a firsthand look at such alien concepts as efficiency and fast friendly service
normally dour citizens broke into grins as they caught the infectious cheerful mood from youthful soviet staffers hired for their ability to smile and work hard
accordions played folk songs and women in traditional costumes danced with cartoon characters including mickey mouse and baba yaga a witch of russian fairy tales
one muscovite accustomed to clerks who snarl if they say anything at all asked for a straw and was startled when a smiling young soviet woman found him one and popped it straight into his drink
for most customers it was their first experience with a hamburger
sandwiches were served in the familiar bag marked with the golden arches but were packed in wrappers bearing cyrillic letters approximating gamburger
they tried them onehanded
they picked their sandwiches apart to examine the contents
one young woman finally squashed her beeg mak to fit her lips around it
it tasted great
a yearold boy said
its a lot different from a stolovaya he continued with a smile referring to the much cheaper but rundown dirty cafeterias that slop rice and fat or boiled sausage
under the sign of the golden arches accented by the soviet hammerandsickle flag hundreds lined up for the longawaited grand opening at  am on pushkin square reaching out excitedly for mcdonalds flags and pins as the hamburger chains army fulfilled the soviet penchant for souvenirs with western logos
publicityconscious managers had the staff shout good morning america
in english and russian for an american tv network
mcdonalds of canada chairman george cohon the man behind the deal said many people were buying multiple orders and the restaurant served  to  people in just the first five hours of operation
the restaurant limited purchases to  big macs per customer in hopes of preventing burgerscalping
mcdonalds built its own factory including bakery dairy meatprocessing plant and even potato storage yard to provide its own guaranteed supplies in a country where up to  percent of the harvest rots en route to the consumer
one mcdonalds associate said the company wound up importing wooden crates from finland for storing potatoes because when they went to build crates they found there was no wood and no nails
they found you need a permit to buy nails

soldiers from three nations locked the doors of checkpoint charlie today and a crane whisked away the cold war relic that symbolized a divided world
a us army band played a stirring song about old berlin as the rectangular white sentry station a place east germans died trying to reach was hoisted onto a truck for its passage into history
the famed allied checkpoint by the berlin wall was closed with an elaborate ceremony that brought together the top diplomats from the germanys and the four world war ii allies
for  years checkpoint charlie embodied the cold war us secretary of state james a baker iii told a crowd of invited guests and journalists on berlins friedrich street
and now  years after it was built we meet here today to dismantle it and to bury the conflicts it created
baker soviet foreign minister eduard shevardnadze and the foreign ministers from france britain and the two germanys each heralded the end of the checkpoint as a symbol of change
shevardnadze called for the removal of berlins status as an alliedcontrolled city and the withdrawal of troops within six months after the two german states unify which could come in december
the proposal as translated into english by the soviets and distributed later to news media apparently would also include the kremlins soldiers stationed just outside the city proper
the united states france and great britain have an estimated  troops in west berlin
berlin has been split into soviet us british and france sectors and west berlin remains technically separate from west germany
the german and allied foreign ministers are meeting in east berlin to discuss the status of the city and a united germanys role in world affairs
all borders are to be opened between the berlins and the germanys by july  when the nations merge their economies
large sections of the berlin wall are being dismantled daily and us officials decided to time the removal of checkpoint charlie with the foreign ministers meeting
a color guard of french british and american soldiers strode to the building and locked the doors leading to each allied nations compartment in the checkpoint
the giant crane then lifted the boxlike building high into the air
us army spokesman sgt
ed mccarthy said he believes it is destined for a museum
checkpoint charlie stood just  yards from an east german checkpoint and was the only place between the berlins that could be crossed on foot by nongermans
the ceremony was closed to the public but not to the residents of the buildings that line friedrich street which had been divided by the berlin wall since 
illa wobig leaned out her window and watched the ceremony unfold just  yards below the fourthfloor apartment where she has lived for  years
i saw eight people shot to death on that street she said
i saw an east german officer try to go under a guard rail
he was shot in the neck
she said she also saw at least  successful escapes by tunnel car and on foot
i saw kennedy reagan and carter give speeches here she said
i saw a james bond movie filmed here
this is wonderful for history but it is sad for me
it was part of my home
east german construction worker andreas bratke was working near the wall in january  when he suddenly bolted through the east german checkpoint down friedrich street and through checkpoint charlie
i ran as fast as i could he said from his home in west berlin
checkpoint charlie is a very important place to me
at this point lennon says he became a househusband to their child while yoko ran the family business
the arrangement continued until lennon told the woman he called mother it was time to make music again
double fantasy followed just before johns death although it was not to be lennons swan song
bruce springsteen has released three albums since  michael jackson two
in contrast lennon  or more accurately ono  has released five albums milk and honey menlove ave the movie soundtrack imagine the john lennon  live in new york collection and a boxed cd collection for christmas 
in addition the lost lennon tapes featuring hours of unreleased lennon music became a popular syndicated radio program
ono has overseen all these projects
people ask me what would he have done in the s
i say lets talk about what he has done in the s because he has definitely she said
in spirit i think hes alive and were getting the benefit
others charge ono with turning her memories into millions without concern for lennons image
a fame magazine profile derided her as the merry widow the nowdefunct weekly  days described her as the decades premier celebrity civil defendant
greed insensitivity egomania
none of onos alleged faults are apparent in an interview
in october a barefoot ono greeted a visitor to the dakota in a highceilinged firstfloor room with white carpet and black onyx walls
curled up on a chair she serenely sipped herbal tea from a mug decorated with a lennon drawing of john and yoko with the inscription grow old with me
the mug is one of an assortment of lennon collectibles available by appointment only from bag one arts inc the entity that controls reproductions of lennons art work
some of that black on white artwork  which includes doodles jotted down on napkins the margins of letters or stray scraps of paper  has been colorized or redone in neon at onos order
people would ask if we had anything in color says lynne clifford who runs bag one for yoko
and yoko said i feel confident enough to add the color myself
so she took the original sketches and we made plates and she added colors
lithographs that sold for  four years ago have increased as much as  times in value she says and new ones cost between  and 
although bag ones gallery a few blocks from the dakota deals primarily in lithographs it also sells the collectibles including  laminated bags that bear lennons drawings
yoko wanted everybody to be able to walk away with something explained clifford
where does all the money go
yoko is very funny about saying where the money goes
but some goes to the spirit foundation she said
the foundation established by lennon and ono before johns death has contributed to causes ranging from a home for drug addicted children to bulletproof vests for police officers
is there anything that will never bear lennons sketchwork
socks clifford said
yoko said she couldnt imagine people walking around on johns drawings
back at the dakota ono receives a familiar question is this all commercialism
has the iconoclastic exbeatle been sold out
she laughs
i didnt sell out john
and im sure john would be happy im still keeping him out there
theres a commercial aspect yes but i mean why not
i was a partner and i still feel that im a partner
drummer andy newmark was touring with roxy music in the summer of  when he got the call that changed his life he was to play on john lennons new album
lennon had been in virtual seclusion for five years busy taking care of his son sean and admittedly out of songwriting ideas
but in  he suddenly felt inspired again and planned to return to the studio to make an album with his wife yoko ono
it was more than a superstar session
afterall lennon gave no press conferences and didnt attend clubs or concerts
rare photos occasionally emerged and he looked different in each one lennon jokingly referred to himself as greta hughes and howard garbo
producer jack douglas who had worked with lennon as an engineer recruited newmark bassist tony levin guitarist hugh mccracken and other new yorkbased sessions players
recording was to take place at the hit factory in manhattan
to newmark lennon was a hero and only a hero
he didnt know him and was nervous about working with him
the drummer guessed he was something like the intense irreverent young man of the movies help
and a hard days night
lennon was those things  and more
his personality seemed so consistent with all we had ever heard about john lennon said newmark who still lives in new york and works with former roxy music singer bryan ferry
his straightforwardness was as visible and apparant as the stories and images we had created
i didnt see anything that seemed startlingly new to the myth
it just appeared to be what we had imagined down to earth direct so direct it could not offend people
newmark spent just one month in the studio playing on the songs that eventually ended up on double fantasy and milk and honey lennons final albums
it was the best experience of my life he insisted
the highlight of my career
the nerves quickly settled
once recording began lennon was just a working musician with the same goal as everyone else finishing the album
the music was mostly mainstream pop no minute jams or political anthems
i hate all that fancy stuff lennon told his drummer
keep it simple like ringo
he was a happy man at this point and his singing was higher sweeter than on earlier albums
lennon was hoping to get back in touch with his audience and the songs were melodic the production lush
dear yoko and grow old with me were tributes to his wife
beautiful boy darling boy was for sean
lennon defended his selfimposed retirement on watching the wheels and summed up his feelings about turning  on borrowed time capping the line good to be older with a selfassured you bet
between takes lennon jammed on buddy holly songs and played host
sushi was the food of choice
the strongest drug was brazilian coffee freshly ground
guys im taking off lennon would say as he poured himself another cup
and there were plenty of stories about the beatles  the bs as john called them
reunions were out of the question a return to adolescence in his opinion but talking about the old days seemed the nicest kind of high
by this time he was old enough to look upon the work they did and be proud of it newmark said
when he talked about the bs it was as if it was his band
he was the spiritual leader
i felt that a lot through the sessions
by the fall newmark had finished working on the album and his contact with lennon was limited to an occasional visit to the studio
but he had planned on working with him again
milk and honey was to come out the following year and lennon wanted to tour using many of the same musicians
life is what happens when youre busy making other plans lennon once sang
it took the drummer a long time to recover from lennons murder the night of dec   he didnt even feel like working for the next few years  everything else suddenly seemed second rate
newmark never listens to the record but still hears woman on the radio
when he thinks about it now its not so much a particular song that hurts him its the daytoday stuff the jokes and wisecracks the coffee and the stories
no one had a reason to remember all that at the time those werent supposed to be farewell sessions
when i looked in his eyes i felt a tremendous depth of character and a tremendous understanding of the human condition a tremendous amount of compassion newmark said
he was totally friendly and open to everybody including the janitor
he had time for everybody
that working class hero thing he was trying to be real about that
its taken the devastation caused by hurricane hugo to stimulate repayment of a yearold debt between two cities almost  miles apart
as a way of repaying a kindness dating to  kingston is raising money to help charleston sc recover
after kingston then new yorks capital was burned in october  by the british new york gov
george clinton received a letter from south carolina gov
abraham livingston
the letter included nearly  new york pounds to help kingston residents get through their crisis
this money has been received for the charitable purpose of alleviating the distresses of the nowindigent inhabitants of the town of kingston who by the ravages of the enemy are reduced to poverty and want livingston wrote on march  
kingston historian edwin ford remembered the letter when hurricane hugo ravaged the carolinas last week
i figured they helped us we should do something for them ford said
on wednesday a local red cross chapter began collecting donations for victims of the hurricane
a lot of people have been calling asking to send donations down there said susan lawlor executive director of the ulster county chapter of the red cross
on tuesday new york state sent two airplanes full of food clothing and water to parts of the caribbean ravaged by hugo

hes ranked as the richest man in the nation by a leading business magazine but to folks in bentonville a town of about  people sam walton is just another neighbor
hes just a part of the community said curt loyd executive director of the bentonville chamber of commerce
hes a neat person
he calls bentonville home and that is special to us
walton who prefers birdhunting tennis and opening new walmart stores to trumpeting his personal financial holdings is again shunning publicity about his third consecutive ranking among the worlds top billionaires
according to forbes magazines july  edition the walton familys estimated worth is  billion up from its  estimate of  billion
he is unavailable said walmart spokesman don shinkle of the silverhaired founder of the nations thirdlargest retail chain based in bentonville about  miles northwest of little rock
shinkle said he received about  calls from reporters monday morning when the forbes list appeared in newspapers
shinkle said news coverage about walton usually sets off a press frenzy for comments from him
but the yearold businessman declined to comment
he feels any attention to sam walton is to the individual and he prefers attention to sam walton the founder of the company shinkle said
he very seldom schedules interviews about his feelings
it just puts him in a position he doesnt want to be
but walton occasionally offers peeks that reveal personal modesty
just after the  stock market crash in which waltons familyowned chunk of walmart stock lost millions in value he quipped in response to questions at a news conference on another topic that it was only paper
walton then changed the subject
walton was first listed by forbes as the nations richest man in october 
three years ago forbes also began listing the worlds wealthiest people
walton made that listing as the richest american every year since
this year he ranks third behind two japanese businessmen
shinkle said walton stays busy visiting many of the more than  stores operated by the company he started as a single fiveanddime at rogers more than two decades ago
he is out of the office up to four days a week the spokesman said
he spends most of his time talking to associates and customers shinkle said and he always comes back with many ideas from them
walmart calls its sales help associates instead of employees
when walton first made the forbes list of richest americans recalled little rock investment banker warren simpson calls came in from all over about the billionaire from the ozarks
they wanted to know about the stock and the company said simpson who works for stephens inc youd think that hed be living in new york or la not bentonville arkansas
but now people just accept it
when it comes out now its just yeah hes still there simpson said
the inch guns on the uss iowa which can lob a shell the weight of a volkswagen  miles have an outdated design that is unfit in the nuclear missile age critics say
theyre oldfashioned and inherently dangerous
they all ought to be eliminated retired rear adm eugene larocque of the center for defense information said thursday
i dont know what more it takes to get people to recognize this ancient technology is no longer appropriate on warships
but the navy defended the inch gun the mightiest in use on any ocean after an explosion killed  sailors wednesday aboard the battleship iowa while a turret crew loaded gunpowder for target practice
this gun  remains the finest naval gun in the world
it was the pinnacle of gun design art and it is still a frontline system said capt
larry seaquist commander of the iowa until last may
the main criticism is that the big gun requires gunpowder packed in silk bags to fire inchdiameter shells from its footlong barrel
it works like the breechloaded guns that roared during the civil war a shell is placed into a barrel and then charged with gunpowder in a separate package
in the iowas case  pounds of powder  six pound bags  is needed to fire a projectile weighing up to  pounds at a speed of  feet per second
an electric spark ignites the powder
the extremely flammable silk is supposed to burn away during the burst but some redhot debris may remain or explosive gases can build up in the barrel
air pressurized to  pounds per square inch can be blown into the breech to clear away debris to guard against a blowback which happens when powder ignites before the breech is closed
in newer guns powder is packed in metal containers
missiles the backbone of the modern navys attack capability have integrated propellants
capt
james bush of the center for defense information a private think tank often critical of pentagon policy said the iowa explosion could have been caused by smoldering debris a blowback or a mishap in the handling of powder
it wasnt unexpected
it wasnt a surprise
this is dangerous technology
its archaic bush said
these are the only guns in the navy that still used bagged powder
the navy said thursday that none of the guns in the iowa turret had been fired before the explosion took place
the navy also on thursday placed a moratorium on firing the big guns found only on the iowa and its three sister battleships the new jersey the wisconsin and the missouri
in a larger sense critics say the battleships themselves once the mainstay of gunboat diplomacy have outlived their purpose
despite inchthick armor plating the battlewagons are vulnerable to submarine and missile attack
the mile range of the inch guns is almost worthless in an era when missiles can be fired at much greater distances
we can do almost anything with a missile and do it better bush said
battleships reached their heyday in world war i and were intended to fight other ships
the iowa first launched in  was the first of an entire class of us battlewagons built to conquer japan
it supported marine amphibious landings and shelled shore targets but the aircraft carrier emerged as the navys top weapon because naval battles were waged without ships ever seeing each other
the iowa also fought off korea
the iowa and three sister warships were ordered out of mothballs in the reagan administrations military buildup six years ago
they were upgraded with tomahawk cruise missiles mm guns and harpoon missiles
one of the battleships the new jersey bombarded syrian and druze positions in lebanon as part the us peacekeeping role in 
but the inch guns often missed their targets which the navy blamed on unreliable powder from world war ii
there was no military need to return these ships to active duty said the cdis larocque
their only military utility is to bombard third world countries and the era of gunboat diplomacy is over
iran is deliberately underreporting the number of casualties from thursdays massive earthquake out of fear of a political backlash leaders of a group seeking to overthrow the countrys islamic leadership say
the regime is very much fearful of public outrage said shahin gobadi spokesman for the peoples mojahedin of iran
theyre very much afraid of the political aftershocks
as gobadi spoke friday members of the organization denounced irans government at a noisy rally held in a park across the street from the white house
northern iran was stuck thursday by an earthquake measuring between  and  on the richter scale
iran has told the united nations that the death toll is at least  but gobadi said his organization has received estimates closer to 
gobadi said the country cannot properly assist earthquake victims because its treasury has been spent in a war with neighboring iraq and against internal opposition
they have been very late in assisting the people he said
sympathy for the earthquake victims was a secondary issue for the chanting flagwaving rally participants who also carried signs criticizing their native country
planning for the event began three weeks before the earthquake but part of the fridays activities focused on irans stricken residents
gobadi said shoddy housing in which the government forced people to live was the cause for the widespread loss of life
this regime has brought them nothing but devastation and misery
this regime has devoted all of its resources to a senseless war with iraq and to oppression of the people at home he said
a unsponsored ceasefire was declared last year after eight years of the iraniraq war
irans islamic republic was established in  after shah mohammad reza pahlavi was deposed by ayatollah ruhollah khomeini and militants seized the us embassy in tehran taking  americans hostage
the united states broke diplomatic relations with iran in april 
the shah died in exile in july  us hostages were freed six months later and khomeini died last june
gobadi said his yearold group had helped depose the shah but had no part in organizing the islamic republic
even in this tragedy for which we grieve we cannot trust the regime in iran rep mervyn dymally dcalif told an estimated  people attending the rally
there were many many victims before this tragedy and there are victims now whose needs need to be addressed by the people of the united states he said
dymally a member of the house foreign affairs committee praised president bushs offer of humanitarian aid to iran but said bush must make sure the assistance is channeled through nongovernment groups
the state department said friday that iran was willing to accept earthquake relief from the american red cross and other us humanitarian organizations

a ceasefire in moldova was threatened yesterday when a truck driver transporting militiamen was shot dead by machinegun fire in the selfproclaimed trans dnestr republic home of the russianspeaking minority
the shooting came shortly after the ceasefire came into effect between the moldovan authorities dominated by ethnic romanians and the minority based in the republic on the east bank of the river dnestr
at least nine people have been killed in clashes over the past week
as in the more severe conflict in nagornokarabakh the underlying tensions are growing and neither side believes it is losing
in other respects however the conflicts are quite different and illustrate the complexity of conflict with which the former soviet union is now faced
the trans dnestr conflict stems directly from the breakup of the soviet union while nagornokarabakh has been a source of tension between azeris and armenians for centuries
moldova formerly moldavia was finally taken under full soviet control in 
the soviet leadership sought to stifle any attempts to preserve its former links with romania  calling moldovan a separate language from romanian and constructing a separate history for the moldovan people
industry was largely situated on the left bank of the dnestr in the sliver of the republic next to ukraine and largely staffed by russians and ukrainians
ukrainians and russians together represent some  per cent of the population with moldovans accounting for  per cent
the little republic m people was slow to respond to the stirrings of reform
when it did in  a language movement quickly put the hardline communist party on the defensive and it lost power in  to the present nationalist government headed by president mircea snegur the former secretary of the moldovan partys central committee
from the beginning of the nationalist movement it was clear that the russian and to a lesser extent the ukrainian minorities would be hostile reacting to laws establishing moldovan as the official language and to calls for renewed union with romania with strikes and demonstrations and finally last year proclaiming trans dnestr independent under a russian president mr igor smirnov
during the august coup last year the moldovan government stoutly rejected it and the trans dnestr authorities welcomed it siding with the soviet army in its brief efforts to impose military rule
thereafter the two sides have gathered military forces
the trans dnestr side has been augmented by cossacks from nearby areas returning to their traditional role as defenders of russias borders
the daily izvestia reported yesterday that the cossacks appear to have appointed themselves mercenaries for the russians they are paid from rbs to rbs a week by the trans dnestr authorities
ray buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were found not guilty thursday of molesting children at the familyrun mcmartin preschool in manhattan beach a verdict which brought to a close the longest and costliest criminal trial in history
an eightman fourwoman jury   of the members parents themselves  acquitted the buckeys of  counts of molestation after deliberating for nine weeks over evidence that had been presented over the course of more than two years
the jury reported it was deadlocked on  remaining counts and a mistrial was declared on those allegations
ray buckey  left the courtroom without comment  free on his own recognizance until a decision is reached on whether the district attorney will retry him on the  undecided counts
but his yearold mother and codefendant reacted with anger
ive gone through hell and now weve lost everything she said outside the court
my concern was for my son and what theyve done to him 
because my son would never harm a child
most jurors said later that they believed the children who testified had been molested but that the prosecution had failed to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the buckeys were culpable
i am not convinced that he ray buckey is innocent said juror sally cordova  a supermarket checker
but it was not proven to me that he did it
whether i believe he did it and whether it was proven are very different
the end of the case came in a tense and crowded courtroom
the buckeys who spent years in jail as the case progressed through the judicial system had sat silently staring straight ahead as the jury filed into the room shortly before  am and the gallery of reporters and spectators grew quiet in anticipation
all the verdicts are the same said los angeles superior court judge william pounders handing them to his court clerk
clerk stan ferrell listed the counts numerically and then reading from the verdict form delivered in a single almost anticlimactic sentence the historic trials close we the jury in the above entitled actions find the defendants not guilty
the quiet of the courtroom was split by a few gasps and sobs
at first the defendants remained stoic then their eyes began to rim with tears
ray buckeys lower lip quivered
his mother dabbed at her eyes with a handkerchief
they said nothing
afterward peggy mcmartin buckey insisted she was not bitter
i knew god would set my son and me free because we have done nothing she said as she was driven away
her optimism was not matched by her son however who she said had had fear definitely about what the jury would decide
i held his hand buckeys mother said after the verdicts were announced and i told him i told you ray and he felt like he wanted to cry but he didnt
the acquittals concluded the longest criminal trial in history a case that stemmed from a  yearolds report to his mother six years ago that he had been sodomized at his school by a mr
ray
the case ultimately cost taxpayers more than  million altered scores of lives and careers and provided a national focal point for the issue of child abuse
judge pounders said he was not surprised by the verdicts i found it difficult to determine how they would view the evidence in the first place
i thought that based on the evidence that was presented the jury could do almost anything and still find rational support for it
it is very difficult to test the credibility of children and when you go beyond that the natural tendency for adults is to look for corroboration
it was very difficult to find corroboration in this case
asked if the case was worth its cost in money lives and stress pounders said he thinks society benefited from the case
people will be much more alert to the possibility of this type of offense taking place at preschool and at schools pounders said
people are no longer dropping their children off and walking away blindly
they look back
they check things out more
in the crowded courthouse hallways parents of alleged victims lashed out at the prosecutors for bungling the case and insisted that their children had not been well served by the judicial system
the system doesnt allow us to protect kids said the father of two alleged victims
i have no doubt these children were abused
said a tearful mother i guess maybe its ok to molest kids
i cant believe this
the children themselves reacted calmly and stood by their accounts
we all know that we are telling the truth said a yearold boy who had testified
no matter what the jury says whatever anybody says this is the truth
we were molested
another of the children said that when the clerk read not guilty on the verdict form my stomach just hollowed out
i was beyond tears
those words will stick with me probably the rest of my life
ill never forget those two words
jurors were critical of the prosecutors methods
in particular they cited the prosecutions reliance on videotapes of controversial pretrial interviews of the young witnesses at a los angeles childabuse center
they also criticized the manhattan beach police departments decision early in the investigation to send out form letters to parents announcing an investigation had begun and soliciting information
the children said juror john breese  a biomedical technician were never allowed to say in their own words what happened to them
that was crucial
said jury foreman luis chang an electrical engineer the key evidence that swayed me was the interview tapes
they were too biased too leading
thats the main crux of it
all said they had entered the jury deliberation room with open minds not only because the judge had so instructed but also because the disjointed testimony had left them confused
i went into the jury room as confused and uncertain as i was the day i first sat in the jury box the first day of this trial said brenda williams  a pacific bell service representative
i felt i had missed out on something maybe i had dozed off during some important testimony and i was hoping some of my fellow jurors had something in their notes that i didnt have in mine that would make it all come together
said juror mark bassett  a computer specialist we just didnt really know what happened
deputy dist
atty lael rubin who prosecuted the case said a decision has not been made about whether to pursue the  counts involved in a mistrial
these counts involve  molestation charges against ray buckey and a conspiracy count that accused both him and his mother
the conspiracy count against peggy mcmartin buckey was dismissed outright thursday
we ultimately must respect the jurys decision rubin said even though i personally disagree with it
the system worked well for them she said in reference to the buckeys
they were lucky
i just hope to god that years from now we dont hear about ray buckey molesting children
los angeles county dist

ira reiner blamed the criminal justice system for the length of the trial and said he backs two state courtreform initiatives
too much time and too much money has gone into this case
this is insane
the very idea a case can go to trial for   years and there can be a rational result is preposterous
the mcmartin case is the very worst example that we have period
but it does not stand alone
defense attorneys dean gits and danny davis were beaming after the verdict announcement
i feel great gits said indicating he had found hope that the decision would go the defense way last week when the jury informed the judge it was reaching deadlock on a conspiracy count
with the acquittal pounders freed more than  million worth of property that had been posted by buckey supporters as bail last year so that he could be released after five years in jail
buckeys mother had been free on a smaller bail amount earlier after spending nearly two years in jail
the mcmartin case  which included allegations not only of rape sodomy oral copulation and other sex crimes but also of pornographic photography sessions naked games field trips away from the school for illicit purposes animal mutilation threats and sataniclike ritual and sacrifice  began in the fall of 
the mother of a  yearold complained to manhattan beach police that her son had been sodomized by mr ray and subsequent physical examinations indicated he had been sexually abused
buckey was arrested in september of that year but was released as the investigation continued and widened to include six other teachers at the manhattan beach nursery school among them his grandmother dozens of uncharged suspects and eight other south bay nursery schools
the manhattan beach police department sent a form letter to hundreds of mcmartin school parents asking for information and a wave of hysteria swept through the affluent beach town
many parents took their youngsters to childrens institute international a los angeles childabuse diagnostic and treatment center for evaluation the majority were told that their children had been victimized
in march  ray buckey was rearrested along with his sister peggy ann buckey his mother peggy mcmartin buckey his grandmother virginia mcmartin and teachers betty raidor babette spitler and mary ann jackson
a county grand jury had indicted them on  counts that indictment was superseded in may by a criminal complaint charging them with  counts involving  children
the case was hastily filed and it was flawed from the beginning

robert philibosian running for reelection and the media which caught wind of the investigation were pressing for action
childrens institute international deluged with concerned parents enlisted untrained therapists to assess the children resulting in videotaped interviews filled with leading and suggestive questions that would later prove embarrassing to the prosecution and provide the defense with grounds for claiming that the alleged victims had been programmed to believe that they had been molested
hysteria grew
hundreds of south bay children had fallen victim to a nationwide conspiracy and pornography ring it was alleged and an angry mob spraypainted ray must die on the walls of the nursery school and began digging up an adjacent vacant lot in search of animal remains
the month preliminary hearing which began in the fall of  was marked by frequent shouting matches between three prosecutors nine defense attorneys and municipal judge aviva bobb and lengthy questioning of child witnesses that lasted in one instance for  days
los angeles was riveted by the daily images of youngsters clambering atop a booster chair in their sunday best to face their alleged molesters
they munched cookies swigged root beer and sometimes sobbed as they told of their experiences at mcmartin
perhaps the most poignant moment came when an yearold girl told in a wispy voice of having been raped photographed tied up and placed in a dark closet by her teachers five years earlier
in the end bobb ordered all seven defendants to stand trial on  charges telling each the court believes there is sufficient cause to believe you are guilty
the remaining charges had been dropped after only  of the scheduled child witnesses came forward to testify
one child was allowed to testify by closedcircuit television under a new state law passed especially for the mcmartin case
but a week later in january  the new district attorney ira reiner who had inherited the case from philibosian dropped charges against five of the seven defendants citing incredibly weak evidence and deciding to proceed only against ray buckey and his mother
the trial itself began with jury selection in april 
testimony began in july
the scope of the trial was narrowed again when several parents decided not to allow their children to testify
eventually nine of  named victims took the witness stand all sticking to their earlier accounts but for minor inconsistencies
toddlers at the time of their alleged abuse and now nearing adolescence they described in graphic detail the abuses they say they suffered at the hands of the buckeys
their testimony was often raw and unsettling
the childrens allegations were supported by medical evidence testified to by physicians
but both buckey and his mother also took the stand and staunchly maintained their innocence
and fellow teachers including former defendants testified that no improprieties in the small school could have occurred without their knowledge
the prosecution sought to show that the children repeatedly had been abused sexually but silenced for years by threats and also that their childlike efforts to tell their parents that something was wrong had been ignored or misinterpreted
the defense contended that nothing untoward happened at the school but that the children were programmed by therapists to believe that something bad had happened to them
it claimed that their stories defied common sense and that the medical evidence was unreliable and perhaps fabricated
the yearlong case was marked by twists and turns and tragedies prompting the judge to comment that it had poisoned everyone it had touched
day after day it was punctuated with the unexpected and bizarre  ailing family matriarch virginia mcmartin now  wrote poetry conducted colorful hallway interviews and tested the judges patience with such outbursts as this awful court
these awful people
these awful lies
 therapist kee macfarlane who conducted many of the interviews in which children first disclosed that they had been molested came under fire when it was revealed not only that she had minimal previous experience in the field but also that she was involved romantically with the television newsman who broke the story
 former prosecutor glenn stevens became a key defense witness after leaking information that he believed that the defendants were innocent and signed a movie contract to tell his revised version of events
 a yearold boy testifying at the preliminary hearing identified everyone from the city attorney and a movie star to a priest and four nuns as among his molesters and painted a picture of marching with his classmates to a cemetery where they dug up corpses with shovels and pickaxes
key figures in the mcmartin trial the judge william r pounders   superior court judge since 
a former state prosecutor who also did appellate work he was assigned to the case after the litigants rejected three other judges as prejudiced

mirrors flagship publication is the tabloid daily mirror with sales of three million copies daily
last month in another moneyraising move mr maxwells maxwell communication corp sold its pergamon press plc unit for  million
in other changes mr maxwells son ian who has been appointed deputy chairman of mirror group will resign from his post at maxwell communication where he was joint deputy managing director
maxwell communication said last month that its management would be taken over by kevin maxwell ians brother
robert maxwell bought mirror group in  from reed international plc for  million
through staff cuts and heavy spending on printing facilities mr maxwell built mirror into one of britains most profitable newspaper groups
in  mirror had profit of  million or  pence a share on revenue of  million
proceeds from the share flotation will be used to strengthen and refinance the groups balance sheet
about  million will be used to pay back bank loans and the rest to pay in full a loan from robert maxwell holdings ltd salomon bros international is underwriting the international part of the offering covering approximately onethird of the shares on sale to be privately placed with institutional investors in the us canada and europe
the other twothirds of the shares are to be divided between private and institutional investors in britain
a relatively low minimuminvestment figure of  has been set to attract small investors particularly readers of mirror publications
on the day of the big event ladbroke the large british betting agency posted the final odds
brian moore was the favorite at  followed by peter ackroyd  iris murdoch  and chinua achebe 
the two dark horses nina bawden and penelope lively were each tipped at 
you may have noticed a distinctly literary tilt to that lineup an affinity with the bookshelf not the bookie
all of those people published new works of fiction here in britain during the past  months
and for the last few weeks literary punters throughout the british isles have been placing bets on which of those writers would win the booker prize the bestknown bestliked and almost incidentally most prestigious fiction award in the land
in recent weeks the booker contenders have received almost as much press coverage as the charles and di rift
and nearly every article from book reviews to author interviews has featured the latest odds
the betting is done largely by literary insiders says graham sharpe who sets the booker odds at william hill britains other big betting agency
they read the books hear the gossip and want to pull off a little coup for themselves he says
last years winner the old devils by kingsley amis was a  favorite but this year anyone who chose the victor made some dough
when she accepted her prize for moon tiger penelope lively looked surprised and pleased
im not a betting woman and i have slight reservations about books becoming a spectator sport she said in soft oxbridge tones
but those who are in the know tell me that  was an irresistible flutter
her yearold mother was among those who made a killing
america has the pulitzer prize for fiction and the national book awards but in terms of excitement hoopla and manonthestreet interest theres nothing akin to the pound  booker prize
with the possible exception of frances respected prix goncourt theres nothing quite like it anywhere else
britons wryly compare the booker to the academy awards and though theres just one prize and no envelope similarities exist
theres a team of judges and a pool of candidates
this year each british publisher could submit three new titles for a grand total of 
as one judge noted wearily by august i was in more than a slight panic sometimes reading all day and evening reading while standing at the bus stop reading while cooking reading almost while talking on the telephone
next comes the shortlist the judges top six which was announced with great fanfare in late september
this year the works included brian moores political thriller the color of blood ep
dutton  pages  peter ackroyds chatterton grove press  pages  nina bawdens circles of deceit st martins press  pages  iris murdochs rd novel the book and the brotherhood viking  pages  nigerian writer chinua achebes anthills of the savannah doubleday  pages  and moon tiger grove press  pages 
the awards presentation came on the last thursday in october and like any major awards presentation it came complete with limousines banquet salmon mousse champagne sorbet and english roast beef and television cameras
the suspense was genuine the judges chose the winner just three hours before the announcement
to be sure the ratings for the primetime broadcast didnt upstage those of eastenders britains popular soap opera
yet interest was sufficient for andre deutsch moon tigers british publisher to order up an additional  copies almost the minute mrs lively  and the nation  heard the news
by british standards sales figures for recent booker winners are stunning from the old devils  hardcover copies to anita brookners hotel du lac  copies
even keri hulmes the bone people a look at maori culture that most readers found impenetrable reached a respectable  in 
shortlisted authors are just a few paces behind sharing the bestseller list with dick francis and scott turow
heinemann initially printed  copies of anthills of the savannah the usual run for contemporary literary fiction
so far  copies have sold
being shortlisted probably changed the destiny of that book declares a member of the heinemann sales staff
indeed theres currently talk of initiating a similar prize with a similar purse for the years best biography
another notable spinoff is the booker harpies readers intent on digesting all six titles then vigorously disputing the choices which never please everyone
this year the sunday times offered readers a complete autographed collection of the six books for the equivalent of  perfect fodder for the literary cocktail party cot
it wasnt always this way of course
headlines were modest back in  when ph
newby won the first ever booker prize for something to answer for
the wonderfully appropriate name comes from bookermcconnell plc the international food and agriculture conglomerate that puts up the prize money each year
the idea was to devise a british equivalent to the prix goncourt and like that august french award the booker attracted attention the minute it kicked up controversy
the early fuss was kept within the literary world with critics sniping over choices and the prizes varied ground rules
the real world took notice in  when elizabeth jane howard one of the three judges wrote a letter to the times claiming that in her opinion kingsley amiss ending up one of the shortlisted books was his best ever
as it happens she was married to mr amis at the time
he didnt win
but many credit the bookers current appeal to the  competition and thomas keneallys schindlers ark or schindlers list as it is known in the us
written as a novel the book told the true story of a remarkable german who saved the lives of hundreds of jews in concentration camps
but even after it won the booker people argued that it wasnt a novel
the more people questioned it the more it sold says ion trewin editorial director at hodder  stoughton
that was the first year the prize caught the media and public imagination
suddenly the booker gained inches on front pages

there are events one never forgets
anyone who was alive in  remembers where he was when president kennedy was assassinated
and anyone who was at candlestick park tuesday night for game  of the world series will never forget
i was in a trailer just outside the stadium about to watch the telecast when the earthquake hit
it was shortly after the network went on the air
my immediate reaction was that a jet was flying very low overhead but soon i knew what was happening
to me the earthquake was not as bad as the whittier quake in october  mainly because i was awake this time
i opened the door to the trailer and looked out
the stadium was shaking and the special concrete joint  one of several strategically spaced around the top of the stadium to prevent earthquake damage  was doing was it was designed to do
it was opening and closing as if the place was made of cardboard instead of concrete
a few people were running out of the stadium but there did not seem to be great alarm because the quake did not last long
i walked into the stadium to interview fans
and again i sensed little panic
most people stayed in their seats waiting to hear whether the game would be postponed
and later when fans started leaving en masse the reaction of those i talked to varied
those who were sitting in the upper deck seemed considerably more shaken than those in the lower levels

cabinet ministers rallied behind john major yesterday by insisting there would be no leadership election this autumn
but the concerted show of support failed to dispel doubts among tory mps about his chances of staying in office
rightwing mps confirmed the findings in an independent on sundaynop national opinion poll poll that michael heseltine was the favourite to replace mr major if he is forced out
but they are calculating that michael portillo will run hard to secure eurosceptic policies from the eventual winner
some of mr majors closest allies were seething with anger at mr heseltine and kenneth clarke the chancellor for posturing before the damaging retreat last week by the prime minister over britains veto powers in the enlarged european union
why were clarke and heseltine trying to sound more portilloesque than portillo
the answers pretty obvious said one cabinet minister
the leadership is hoping that over the easter recess the conservative constituencies will urge their mps to stop the damaging infighting which they believe is overshadowing the governments fightback on the economy law and order and education
that message was reinforced by three cabinet ministers who broke their easter sundays to support mr major
john patten the secretary of state for education said he is a man of very great resilience
it must be tough for him
no one likes the level of criticism he has been getting
but he will be carrying on a  to year programme begun in  through to the next general election
michael howard the home secretary said there is no prospect of any leadership contest
john major is going to lead the conservative party successfully into the next general election
he dismissed one poll of  mps which showed that  of them believed there would be a change of leadership
lord wakeham leader of the house of lords used a letter to his former constituency of colchester south to issue a general call to tories for loyalty to mr major
our support for him should not only be loyalty to a proven winner but also backing for a man who has ideas ambitions and ability to take britain to success in the st century lord wakeham said
their calls were described as ritualistic by one leading rightwing tory mp
john major has done himself great damage
there will not be a coup next week
it will depend on how we do in the local and european elections
but there will be a stalking horse candidate this autumn
theres little doubt about that he said
however tory right wingers said last night that they would support mr major because there was no credible rightwing candidate
mr portillo  was too young and they still regarded mr heseltine as an interventionist leftwinger
if a challenge does take place they will press mr portillo to stand to secure key commitments including no british entry into a single european currency
three of the tory mps who have been rumoured as possible stalking horses  teresa gorman tony marlow and sir richard body  appeared to rule themselves out
the odds against mr major surviving have shortened from evens to  against over the past  hours
the prime minister told journalists at his huntingdon conservative club at the weekend that he would not be forced out by the speculation
it hasnt stopped me in the past two years
it isnt going to stop me now

police spokeswoman susan williamson said there had been minor looting the night of the storm but no arrests
the temperature which had risen to  before the storm wednesday plunged into the s early thursday while rescuers worked through the night under the glare of floodlights
the lights powered by generators produced an eerie glow in a area that was otherwise largely without power
tall cranes lifted the heavy rubble while workers with flashlights picked through the smaller pieces
as daybreak came people began returning to the scene some to look for valuables in ravaged cars or businesses others simply out of curiosity
many carried cameras or videocassette recorders
police maj robert moder said there was no indication that anyone was left in the rubble

moder said  people were injured and more than  of those required at least overnight hospital treatment

about  banks became concerned last summer at the behaviour of businesses run by robert maxwell several months before he died and his business empire collapsed
their concern arose when maxwell communication corporation made late payments to them a financial times investigation has discovered
yet although some banks became alarmed at the implications for the financial health of his empire they did not discuss their concerns with each other or with authorities such as the bank of england
mr basil brookes mccs former finance director has described his shock to the ft at discovering last august that mcc had failed to settle foreign currency transactions with about  banks on time
starting about july   mccs treasury under the authority of maxwell and his son kevin had begun to buy and sell enormous amounts of foreign currencies
in these spot transactions mcc would buy a currency in one financial centre promising to make payment in another centre
on a number of occasions mcc received the currency but did not make the payment  thereby giving itself an unauthorised loan
mr brookes says about  banks including lloyds bank of america goldman sachs and swiss bank corporation were involved in the flurry of foreign exchange deals
at least dollars m pounds m in unapproved credit is thought to have been raised this way
a former maxwell employee said some appeared to have been channelled into private maxwell businesses
one banker said attempts to raise money by making late payments in the foreign market was a relatively wellknown ruse with the nickname called teaming and lading
it also emerged yesterday that national westminster bank the biggest lender to the maxwell private companies felt badly let down by maxwell because he failed to deliver funds on time at the end of july
at a meeting between maxwell and mr john melbourn a natwest director on july  natwest refused maxwells request for a loan of pounds m
natwest was upset three weeks later when it provided funds  less than pounds m  to the maxwell empire on the understanding that it would be repaid the same day and then found that repayment was not made
natwest was forced to convert this intraday transaction into a shortterm loan which was eventually repaid
the bank told both robert maxwell and mr kevin maxwell that it was concerned that repayment had not been made but it did not discuss the problem with other banks or with the bank of england
instead it pressed on with its policy of reducing the size of its loans to the maxwell businesses
natwests loans to the maxwell empire now total pounds m half the level of two years ago
later last year robert maxwell made many repayments to banks by looting pension fund assets and also carrying out unusual fundraising exercises with us investment banks from which tens of millions of dollars were borrowed at a high price

following her operation last week her first words to her daughter lucie were wouldnt you know  this is the day i was going to get my hair done
miss ball had been improving steadily from the heart surgery so her death came as a shock
she had been walking her spirits were up
her family was with her wise said
she responded as well as anyone could respond to that kind of surgery
he said she woke up early wednesday complaining about a sudden pain in her back and in a matter of seconds went into a full cardiac arrest that was caused by a ruptured aorta
miss ball and her late former husband desi arnaz starred in i love lucy from  to 
in the groundbreaking show still seen in syndication worldwide the late vivian vance and william frawley played their neighbors fred and ethel mertz
probably a lot of what she did rubbed off on what i do said actresscomedian jane curtin star of the sitcom kate and allie
but it couldnt be helped because i memorized her shows
the show one of the most popular in television history was distinguished by miss balls faultless timing rubberfaced expressions widemouthed wails and extravagant pratfalls
working with lucy was like receiving an ma
or a phd in comedy recalled joan rivers
what she forgot about comic timing and delivery is more than most of us will ever learn in a lifetime
comedian whoopi goldberg said lucy was great because she represented every person
she showed us human foibles and gave us a chance to laugh at ourselves
miss goldberg said her favorite episode involved a visit by the i love lucy characters to hollywood where lucy and ethel spotted actor william holden in a restaurant
that was how we would all react to seeing a movie star in a restaurant miss goldberg said
she was looking at him in a compact mirror and trying to look at him surreptitiously
and thats just an example of how everyone can identify with lucy
bob rosati who lives down the street from the beverly hills home miss ball shared with husband gary morton said he was watching a rerun of i love lucy on wednesday morning when the screen went black and the words in memory of lucille ball  appeared
i felt i had lost someone in my family
i couldnt believe it said rosati 
i was watching lucy like i do every morning
shes one of the mostadmired ladies in this town
he was among a group of fans who stood reverently outside miss balls home on roxbury drive as florists delivered baskets of flowers to the house

admirers included president bush in southern california at the time of miss balls passing and former president reagan
her red hair her antics on the screen her timing and her zest for life made her an american institution the former president and nancy reagan said in a statement
just the mention of her name brings a smile
 we love lucy and will miss her deeply
lucille ball possessed the gift of laughter bush said
but she also embodied an even greater treasure  the gift of love
she appealed to the gentler impulses of the human spirit
she was not merely an actress or comedienne
she was lucy and she was loved
to baby boomers a happy chunk of our childhood is missing said saturday night live comedian victoria jackson who was born two years after i love lucy went off the air as a regular series
she didnt make me laugh out loud i remember she just made me happy about life
said comic tim conway were going to miss this lady but not really because shes still here
all those wonderful things they did together  those wonderful tv shows  are still available
although miss ball hadnt visited her hometown of jamestown ny since  and had no family there she had stayed in touch with friends
irene rosseti who now lives in celoron ny said miss ball recently had sent her and her husband a letter on their th wedding anniversary
even though she was a big star she was still just lucy to us she recalled

the image of a dour shoeless english boy and his absent carefree mother prompted julia baird and geoffrey giuliano to collaborate on a book
the boy is the public image of young john lennon bairds halfbrother and giulianos idol
but the neglected urchin and his liveitup mother  who was also bairds mother  never existed the authors say
that woman laughing singing dancing saying goodbye to john and john standing there alone crying mummy mummy
thats not my brother thats not my mother thats not my childrens grandmother said baird who recently spent three weeks in the united states promoting her book a family portrait of lennon and his liverpool roots
published in north america last fall john lennon my brother was coauthored by giuliano a beatles aficionado who lives in this erie canal city about  miles north of buffalo
the twoyear crossatlantic collaboration came from two different motives
giuliano wanted to do a book about lennon
baird wanted to do a book about the exbeatles maligned mother whose name also was julia
the result is a little of both a mishmash of anecdotes showing a moody but generally happy liverpool boy singing with his mother in a bathroom with good acoustics
baird disagrees with other biographies which say that after his father decamped and julia turned her son over to her sister mimi lennon was a grim youth who felt abandoned by his mother
i didnt do it for john said baird
i wanted to set the record straight about our mother and that ties in with john
i feel my mother has been badly misrepresented in the press
baird a yearold teacher in cheshire england was born seven years after lennon to julia and her commonlaw second husband john dykins
she and her younger sister jacqui grew up with their parents amid an extended family of aunts uncles cousins  and big brother john
the book tells of the sisters getting hauled out of the bathtub when teenagers lennon paul mccartney and george harrison drop by for bathroom jam sessions with julia
it tells of an alternately thoughtless and protective brother who leaves his stepsisters at the movies for hours while he goes on a date who between songs at a beatles concert shouts for security guards to lift the dykins girls out of the front row away from screaming fans threatening to storm the stage
but mostly it tells of a mother and son who while living apart had a loving relationship
the book got its start after baird watched a british television special in  marking the fifth anniversary of lennons murder
the show presented julia as an unfit mother no mother at all baird said
baird complained and was urged to tell her story
she wrote an essay and arranged to publish it in liverpool
then she met giuliano who was in liverpool to promote his first book the beatles a celebration
giuliano  a selfproclaimed huckster convinced baird to work with him on a book which he pieced together from interviews with baird in england
while proofreading the text baird sent a copy to mccartney
he sent his blessing plus a bonus a brief foreword for the book
with a collection of rare early photos the book is more a family album than a biography
giulianos text reads like oral history as if a british schoolteacher had spread the family scrapbook across the readers knees to boast about her brother the musician
however the book is a narrow view of lennon a childs recollections of an aspiring brother
after julia was killed in a traffic accident in  baird saw less and less of lennon losing contact with him for years when he and wife yoko ono moved to the united states
the end of the book describes what baird calls lennons desire to regain his lost liverpool roots when she and her stepbrother exchanged letters and phone calls during 
baird has been accused of cashing in on her stepbrother but insists she just wants to tell the familys story of lennons early years
i could have cashed in when john was alive baird said
when john died the tabloids in england were knocking on the door saying write your story name your price
we quickly showed them the door
also shown the door was albert goldman whose sordid biography the lives of john lennon hit bookstores about the same time as bairds book
baird who read goldmans scathing biography of elvis presley said she turned down an interview with goldman who brands lennon homosexual anorexic and possibly a murderer
i had heard goldman was doing the book six years ago and i knew what the tone would be baird said
most people including goldman write books based on other books that have it all wrong
giuliano was harsher
goldman was in it for the money from day one giuliano said
goldman knows the formula the more sleaze the more dough
so whats his motive
if he writes the sleaziest book he makes the most dough
baird herself wasnt blind to the business end of publishing

president corazon aquino has agreed to allow ferdinand marcos to return to the philippines so that the government can try him on charges of stealing billions of dollars newspapers said saturday
the manila bulletin and the manila chronicle quoted mrs aquinos press secretary teodoro benigno as saying that mrs aquino made the assurance to two swiss lawyers before she visited switzerland earlier this month
the reports did not say when criminal charges against marcos aquinos ousted predecessor will be filed or when mrs aquino will allow him to return
mrs aquino has refused to allow marcos into the philippines citing security reasons
marcos lives in exile in hawaii
mrs aquinos government has said it will file criminal charges against marcos whom it has accused of stealing up to  billion in government funds
but the government has not done so because of mrs aquinos refusal to let marcos enter the country
philippine law does not allow trial in absentia
swiss lawyers are helping the philippine government trace money that marcos and his family allegedly placed in swiss bank accounts
marcos has been living in hawaii since he was toppled by the civilianmilitary revolt that swept mrs aquino to power in february 
the swiss government has frozen the assets of marcos and his associates and has not released information on them to the philippine government because of legal challenges posed by marcos lawyers and swiss banks
the unidentified swiss lawyers said the information will not be turned over unless and until there is an assurance that formal charges will be filed against him benigno was quoted as saying
swiss law allows the lifting of banking secrecy laws only in case of criminal prosecution
mrs aquino has said she would allow marcos to return now only if he and his family swore allegiance to her government and returned the money he allegedly stole during his year rule
she said later she would abide by any court decision if marcos lawyers in the philippines raised the matter of his return to the courts
benigno was quoted as saying that mrs aquino has to accept the possibility of marcos returning home
rep larry combest rtexas issued a terse statement tuesday supporting defensesecretary designate john tower but refused to comment on a published report that he told senate armed services committee leaders that tower used to drink up to a bottle of scotch at a sitting
an unidentified congressional source told the washington post that combests statement about towers drinking habits in the s came down on sen sam nunn the committee chairman like a ton of bricks and was a factor in nunns opposition to the nomination
the newspaper reported that combest later gave a different story to the fbi saying that tower and a group of friends  not tower alone  had frequently consumed a bottle of scotch
after meeting with staff and advisers combest who worked for thensen tower in the s issued a twosentence statement supporting his fellow texan
as a member of congress i have tremendous respect and full confidence in the senator and his abilities to lead this countrys armed forces
in my judgment john tower will be a superb secretary of defense the statement said
combest spokesman rich adams refused to comment further and said combest was not available to speak to reporters
the washington post reported that combest described for nunn and sen john w warner of virginia the ranking republican on the committee towers heavy drinking bouts in the s
a congressional source was quoted as saying that combest told the senators that tower would drink as much as a full bottle of scotch two or three times a week
trudi boyd combests administrative assistant told the post that combest originally went to nunn and warner to tell them tower had ended his previous excessive abuse of alcohol
boyd also told the post that a group of people drank the entire bottle of scotch not tower alone
that was the account combest gave the fbi following his talk with nunn and warner the newspaper said
it said that in that account combest said that he had only seen tower drunk on two or three occasions
tower has acknowledged that he drank excessively in the s but says he has reduced his intake to wine with dinner
on sunday he promised to not drink a drop of alcohol if confirmed as defense secretary
combest  worked for tower for seven years  as a legislative assistant handling agricultural legislation and policy
tower served in the senate for  years deciding not to seek reelection in 
he was chairman of the senate armed services committee from  through 
the committee now controlled by democrats voted  along party lines last thursday to recommend the full senate reject towers nomination
three decades ago a west german politician said german reunification was a sleeping lioness that would awake one day with a mighty roar
now there is growing speculation the awakening may be at hand to create a giant political and economic machine that could dominate europe
reunification is coming closer but i cant say whether it will take   or  years says west german conservative lawmaker eduard lintner
we have the impression that things are much more concrete than we could have imagined five years ago
the daily sight of thousands of refugees fleeing east german leader erich honeckers hardline communist rule for the capitalist west has revived international interest in the debate
once dismissed as a nostalgic daydream the idea of german reunification has gotten a public nod from president bush and something short of a categorical no from president mikhail s gorbachev of the soviet union
the idea makes east german leaders virtually apopletic
if there were a free choice under the present circumstances in the german democratic republic east germany certainly  percent to  percent would vote for national reunification with the federal republic of germany added the yearold lintner in an associated press interview
the west german constitution calls for a united germany but it has not been a paramount concern of the west germans in the years since the ruins of nazi germany were divided into east and west at the end of world war ii
full national reunification would completey rework the postwar european order mapped out by the conquering allies
it is a prospect that creates unease in britain and france and in poland in the east bloc
londons prestigious sunday times on sept  mapped out a possible scenario that includes massive troop reductions in europe honeckers death and further westernization of poland and hungary
moscow unilaterally abolishes the warsaw pact after guarantees from poland and hungary they will not join other alliances the times futuristic view continued
west germany withdraws from nato and a referendum in both east and west germany votes for reunification and neutrality
that sort of talk is being heard more and more as moscow loosens its hold on the east bloc and countries like the soviet union poland and hungary explore democratic reforms
the implications of pulling down the berlin wall and other barriers to link the two german states are enormous and for many ominous
as much of western europe heads towards its own unification in  the economic center of gravity would be shifted even further to the german side with a powerhouse of nearly  million people   million west germans and  million east germans
west germany is already europes largest exporting nation and despite its many flaws east germanys economy is the envy of many soviet bloc neighbors
a unified germany could become the political focal point of a continent already in flux as democratic movements sweep parts of the soviet bloc
older generations recall eerie echoes of nazi dictator adolf hitlers boasting that he had brought about the unity of the german nation
eva kulesza head of research for the soviet union and eastern europe at the french institute of international relations says she believes that as far as public opinion there is new sort of mistrust toward germany
this new fear of germany is linked to german economic trends
germany is much stronger much more dynamic than france she added
since west germany and east germany are at the front lines of two competing alliances any signs for eventual reunification would have to come from washington and moscow
during a news conference last week in montana bush said that reunification is a matter for the germans to decide
but he added if that reunification was worked out between the germanys i do not think we should view that as bad for western interests
for his part gorbachev evaded the issue during a news conference in bonn in june saying only the situation in europe today was determined by historical realities
outside germany political leaders and commentators have been sharply divided on the issue
in thinking about the german question we ought not to be governed by old prejudices and outofdate assumptions wrote commentator peter jenkins in londons the independent
the cold war was conducted in the name of freedom and today if the coming of freedom to east germany brings a desire for unity which finds its echo in the federal republic we ought not to be opposed
willy brandt the social democrat who sought greater ties to the east as chancellor in the s said german unity doesnt necessarily mean a single state although he called reunification a hypothesis that cannot be excluded
as talk grows in the west the positions against reunification almost seem to harden in east germany as people leave the country in nearrecord numbers
more than  east germans are expected to resettle in west germany this year leaving a gaping hole in the communist nations work force
little is likely to change in east germany as long as the yearold honecker and his aging comrades stay in power
during a september  visit to bonn honecker called respect for europes present borders a basic condition of peace
socialism and capitalism cant be any more united than fire and water honecker added on the issue of reunification
there are virtually no indications that honeckers successors will be inclined to democratic reforms let alone joining the capitalist west
the calls for reunification have already found a sympathetic ear among some leaders of the polish solidarity movement in the country that suffered some of the nazis most brutal savagery
after all the abnormal situation of the german nation overshadows the whole of polishgerman relations member of parliament adam michnik wrote on monday in the prosolidarity daily newspaper gazeta wyborcza which he edits
the renewed talk of reunification is recalling the nearly prophetic words of reinhold maier a prominent west german state governor who later went on to head the centrist free democratic party
reunification is resting in our midst like a sleeping lioness
tired and weak indecisive people in west germany are trying not to disturb her sleep maier predicted in 
the lioness will one day wake up blink snap her her tail and start to roar
still many in both east and west still agree with the  quip by nobel prizewinning french author francois mauriac i love germany so much im delighted that there are two of them
one year after his election dan quayle has achieved all he ever wanted he has become dull
his comingout party last sunday was a true test of his new ability to not make news
he went on meet the press
this was no small thing
during his entire campaign for the vice presidency quayle refused all requests from such national interview shows
he didnt appear on meet the press or this week with david brinkley or face the nation
and he didnt do so because back then he was making too much news
his every slip his every gaffe his every goof was news
he was the stuff of nightly tv monologues
a lot of people feel quayle is just too inexperienced for a donothing job jay leno once said
that joke was not only funny but it got to the heart of a strange phenomenon americans didnt give a damn about the vice presidency mike dukakis tried to make quayle a major issue and failed but some also felt that quayle wasnt qualified for a job that had no qualifications
so when quayle got to washington he got there with one goal support the president and make himself a very small target
stay out of the headlines and give no reason for anyone to dump him in 
we had asked him on the show a number of times christie basham senior producer of meet the press told me but he always declined
we renewed our request and then after saying he would not do the show he changed his mind and said he would
it was the nd anniversary of the show and we wanted someone above and beyond the usual guest
and it says something about dan quayles reputation that he would be considered above and beyond the usual guest
normally a vice president would not be
thats because vice presidents dont actually do anything
they dont run departments or make policy
they mostly wait for heads of state to expire
as george bush once joked about his duties as vice president you die i fly
but quayle was considered a hot tv guest because he might screw up
he might make a mistake or say something outrageous or disagree with the president
none of this happened
the show was uneventful
quayle answered all the questions put to him and he made little if any news
some major newspapers didnt even bother to do a story the next day
it was everything quayle had hoped for
i asked david beckwith his spokesman why quayle had waited so long to go on a major interview show
well he wanted to concentrate on the more important part of the job beckwith said
he wanted to solidify his relationship with the president and learn the inner workings of the administration
so why go on now
it seemed like a particularly opportune week beckwith said
george bush and mikhail gorbachev had announced a summit
central america was back in the news
and oh yeah bush had said dan quayle would be on the ticket in 
and marlin fitzwater bushs spokesman called and just suggested we do the show beckwith said
the selection of dan quayle had been bushs first major and some would say only decision of his presidential campaign
he had input from a number of people but quayle was george bushs choice
many thought it was a terrible choice but there is nothing like a victory to give everything a rosy glow
and bushs announcement that quayle would be his running mate again was bushs way of saying i didnt screw up the first time
i made a decision and it was the right decision and just to show you how right it was i am making it again
and now was the time for quayle to go on meet the press and show everybody just how right george bush had been
i asked beckwith if quayle had been pleased by how the show had gone
he was especially pleased with the seriousness of the questions beckwith said
a lot of the time you never know what youre going to get into
sometimes the questions can be not particularly serious
a typical example of a nonserious question often put to dan quayle is why does everyone say your wife is smarter than you
but quayle got no questions like that last week
i asked christie basham of meet the press if quayle had asked in advance who the questioners would be
yes basham said but almost all the guests do
quayles questioners were david broder of the washington post and elizabeth drew of the new yorker both of whom stuck to serious questions
if quayle had been told the questioners were going to be hunter thompson and jimmy breslin i have a feeling quayle might have come down with laryngitis
after the show fitzwater called quayle to express his and presumably the presidents pleasure at how quayle had handled himself
quayle had said very little and he had said it very well
the very limitations of a vice presidents role dont make him an ideal guest beckwith admitted
almost by job description a vice president is not permitted to make serious news
and quayle knows his future is in sticking to that
during the  campaign i interviewed quayle and i came away with one overwhelming impression dan quayle would run for president in 
and he will do so i believe by being a vice president who keeps his head down his nose clean and his life dull
after all it worked for george bush
the shuttle that put the hubble space telescope into orbit also carries an instrument used in the s by astronomer edwin hubble the eyepiece from what once was the worlds most powerful telescope
its a great pleasure to have something of such historical significance and something that so directly symbolizes edwin hubbles fundamental contributions to astronomy astronaut kathy sullivan said friday as she circled the earth in space shuttle discovery
the eyepiece from the mount wilson observatorys inch hooker telescope was carried into orbit by sullivan
after she brings the eyepiece back to earth it will be placed on display at the observatory
its basically a symbolic gesture from the past of astronomy to the future of astronomy said lyn mcafee spokeswoman for the mount wilson institute
the pasadenabased group runs the observatory located in the san gabriel mountains outside los angeles
the discoveries made by hubble on the inch telescope at mount wilson gave us a giant leap forward in our understanding of the universe mcafee said
we believe the hubble space telescope will do the same thing
the hooker telescope was the worlds most powerful telescope from its construction in  until  when the inch hale telescope was placed in operation at mount palomar observatory northeast of san diego
using the hooker telescope hubble was the first to determine the distance to a galaxy outside the milky way the institute said in a statement
this crucial discovery provided the first definite proof that other galaxies existed far beyond the confines of our own local galaxy the institute said
during the s and s hubble and an assistant used the hooker telescope to take thousands of photographs of faint galaxies showing that most of them were moving away from each other very quickly
this provided observational evidence for the concept suggested by einsteins theory of relativity that the universe is expanding the institute said
hubbles work helped convince scientists the universe was created in a giant explosion called the big bang an estimated  billion years ago
the hooker telescope was mothballed in  by the carnegie institution former operator of the observatory in a moneysaving move
the institute hopes to obtain funds to reopen it

mcfadden and his wife taffe run their dog handling business in campbell and do it primarily for the enjoyment and satisfaction it brings
those who think you can get rich handling dogs are barking up the wrong tree

 mcfadden said he handles an average of  to  dogs at each show and works around  shows a year all over the us
the dogs are frequent winners in best of breed and best of show categories
we finish with close to  champions a year he said
 as a handler mcfadden emphasizes that he doesnt do obedience training
his job is to trim and condition the dogs and prepare them physically and mentally
the aim he said is to have a confident and happy dog entering a competition
 over the last seven years mcfadden and his wife have shown dogs representing approximately  percent of the  breeds of dog
taffe mcfadden a vancouver british columbia native who has been involved in dog handling since she was a child specializes in poodles

the indian government flew federal paramilitary troops into bombay last night after more than a dozen bombs exploded in the city killing about  people and injuring more than a thousand
the devices mostly car bombs appeared to be a systematic attack on indias commercial heart
all exploded within  minutes in the afternoon
among the targets were the bombay stock exchange the landmark air india building a shopping complex and two hotels near the airport
the identity of the bombers was unknown but the attacks were a severe setback to indias attempts to heal the wounds created by recent intercommunal violence which has caused deep shock throughout india
more than  people died in riots including over  in bombay after the razing of a mosque at ayodhya in northern india by hindu zealots on december 
the bombs appeared designed to stir a renewal of communal strife and to undermine efforts by the government of mr pv narasimha rao to open up the economy and attract foreign investment and tourism
one of the targets was close to the headquarters of shiv sena a hindu nationalist party accused of fomenting violence during the riots in which most victims were moslems
national and local state leaders appealed for calm in an attempt to prevent a renewed outbreak of violence
mr rao urged the nation to ignore rumours after the inhuman and criminal bomb blasts
mr sharad pawar the former federal defence minister just reappointed chief minister of maharashtra state said all roads into bombay had been blocked and the army put on alert
he said it is aimed at disrupting the economy and it appears a conscious effort because only bombay seems to be the target
mr shankarrao chavan the federal home interior minister told parliament in new delhi we suspect an international conspiracy
the indian high commission in london said the attacks were part of the externally supported terrorism which has targeted india for some time
however indian officials stopped short of directly accusing pakistan the countrys archenemy
the bomb attacks were spread throughout the city and were clearly aimed at the citys betteroff business people  in contrast to the riots in which victims were mainly poor
at the storey stock exchange building about  people were on the secondstorey trading floor when a bomb exploded in the underground car park hurling shards of glass across the floor and into the street
some victims were crushed in the stampede to escape
outside burned bodies lay among litter from shattered buildings
nanchang  jun xinhua  a central work team led wen jiabao alternate member of the cpc central committee political bureau and member of the cpc central committee secretariat arrived in jiangxi from hunan this morning to provide onthespot guideance for jiangxi to conduct floodfighting and relief work and to resume industrial and agricultural production
immediately after disembarking from the plane wen jiabao and his party  accompanied by mao zhiyong secretary of the jiangxi provincial party committee and governor wu guanzheng  successively rushed to the nanchang bridge the leigongao construction work site along the nanchangjiujiang highway which is reserved for vehicles weidong village under changling town in xinjian county and houtian townships sanzhou village
they inspected the flood situation along the ganjiang river visited the masses of flood victims and extended greetings and appreciation to the servicemembers and civilians who have been performing rescue and emergency tasks
the same evening wen jiabao and his party earnestly listened to reports by the jiangxi provincial party committee and government on jiangxis flood situation and its floodfighting and relief work
wen jiabao highly commended jiangxis servicemembers and people for their spirit that stresses fostering unity and coordinated efforts striving to help and rescue themselves and continually fighting when encountering extraordinarily disastrous floods
he also fully affirmed jiangxis preliminary victories in its floodfighting and relief work
wen jiabao pointed out at present the ganjiang rivers waterlevel is declining but the jiangxi provincial party committee and government are still facing very arduous tasks
while continually and properly conducting floodfighting and relief work along the ganjiang river valleys we should stress floodprevention in the poyang lake area and should promptly organize the masses in the disasterstricken areas to resume production so as to be selfreliant and to rebuild their homes
jiangxi is a major agricultural province
we should take measures to promptly salvage the earlyripening rice and should expand the planting of lateripening rice and autumn grain as much as possible so as to attain a bumper harvest of grain for the whole year
while carrying out floodfighting and relief work we should also continually and properly handle various tasks concerning reform stability and development in jiangxi
it has been learned that on  june wen jiabao and his party will visit other localities including xingan fengcheng and jian where the flooding has been the most serious
they will further inspect the flood situation and extend sympathy and solicitude to flood victims there
the shortlist of six for the pounds  booker prize for fiction announced yesterday immediately prompted the question who
from many in the publishing industry
according to one insider some on the list are bteam writers at best
the six include alan hollinghursts the folding star published by chatto and windus a melancholy study of homosexual obsession which was tipped as a likely candidate from the initial long list of  the reef granta by young sri lankan writer romesh gunesekera and how late it was how late secker and warburg by gritty glasgow realist james kelman which was almost universally wellreviewed
as for the other three  knowledge of angels green bay a philosophical fable by childrens author jill paton walsh paradise hamish hamilton by zanzibarborn writer abdulrazak gurnah and beside the ocean of time john murray by yearold orcadian poet george mackay brown  frankly they dont make the grade
the shortlist for the booker the uks most hyped literary prize and one of the most lucrative is all the more surprising in a bumper year for new fiction fulfilling the criteria  english language and nonamerican  for consideration for the award
margaret atwoods the robber bride seems an astonishing omission as do new novels by peter ackroyd peter carey candia mcwilliam william trevor and jim crace
but if the shortlist of the final six candidates for the prize may be disappointing the traditional controversy surrounding the award is as rife as ever
one unsurprising omission from the final selection was when the world was steady a first novel by claire messud which was on the long list before it was pointed out that the author was the wife of james wood chief literary reviewer of the guardian newspaper and a booker judge
professor john bayley chairman of the booker panel and husband of former booker prize winner dame iris murdoch expressed surprise at mr woods failure to reveal his relationship with ms messud
but it is the final list rather than the controversy that discredits the award according to some critics
this list said one man of letters must have dealt a final death blow to the booker
the winner selected from an original  will be announced on october 
on telegraph hill jerry lubenow got his biggest shock when he arrived at his apartment after the deadly earthquake
there was no damage to our place or in our neighborhood he said
the only thing lubenow could figure out was that telegraph hill is on rock
he then talked to friends who live on nob hill and russian hill which are also situated on rock and learned that their residences also avoided damage
you almost feel guilty he said referring to his own good fortune
its like living through the blitz in london in the second world war
only a few miles away in san franciscos affluent marina district dozens of fashionable townhouses were damaged or destroyed
some buckled and pitched forward off their foundations into the street
others appeared outwardly sound but sustained interior damage that rendered them uninhabitable
why did some of the luxury fourstory apartment buildings collapse at the marina while in nearby chinatown shops made of unreinforced masonry sustained little damage in the  temblor
why did highrises that form the elegant san francisco skyline escape virtually unscathed while an office building in the citys southeast district peel apart killing five pedestrians below
the buildings that collapsed did so because of a combination of two things very poor soil and very poor structural design said peter i yanev chairman of eqe engineering inc a structural engineering firm in san francisco
they were on top of the worst soil conditions in the city explained yanev who said he has traveled to all the major earthquakes in the last  years studying their impact on construction
the soil beneath the marina district where six buildings burned down or collapsed is made up of landfill partly dredged from the bay more than  years ago
yanev said many of the buildings in the neighborhood were erected in the early part of this century when there were no earthquake codes
what collapsed and killed some people were fourstory apartment buildings that had garages built all the way along the bottom floor yanev said
so you have a bunch of garages underneath all these apartments
you effectively have no walls on one side of the building
the connections just break and the front end falls into the street
yanev called the two conditions a disaster waiting to happen
should we have an earthquake centered off the golden gate bridge instead of santa cruz youd probably have hundreds of these buildings collapse he said
experts said they did not anticipate that the marina district would be the major problem in an earthquake
the worst areas they believed would be chinatown and the tenderloin where brick buildings abound
chinatown survived relatively intact yanev said because it is located up in the hills atop very firm soil and the epicenter of the temblor was many miles away
in the citys highrise office towers a few broken windows and other cosmetic damage could be seen
a preliminary survey found only three skyscrapers rendered unsafe by the quake
but most buildings including the landmark transamerica pyramid were not touched
jay cahill an owner of cahill construction co a contractor that built several highrises in the city said the earthquake codes did their job
what this quake proves is that the engineers were right when they said tall buildings could withstand a strong quake he said
they said the downtown buildings are constructed to withstand a quake of at least  magnitude with an epicenter in san francisco
earthquake experts said they were not surprised that the highrises swayed with the earthquake while fourstory buildings collapsed
an earthquake means that the ground shakes and that means force is applied to the sides of buildings said george c lee acting director of the national center for earthquake engineering research at the university of buffalo
when architects design skyscrapers lee said they factor in wind gusts and earth movement  forces that are not considered as much when constructing smaller buildings
in smaller buildings he said contractors usually make sure that vertical forces  such as snow and ice  cannot force a structure to collapse
throughout the bay area residents were left to puzzle over why the earthquake savaged some buildings and bypassed others much like san francisco was left to wonder why the marina district was hard hit and others spared
in santa cruz initial damages were estimated at  million and  of the downtown mall  the heart of the city  was severely damaged
an estimated  commercial buildings must be razed a county official said
in los gatos  miles northeast of santa cruz portions of the downtown area were destroyed
several dozen victorian homes were shifted off their foundations and numerous chimneys crumbled
san francisco fire officials said as many as  buildings in the marina district may have to be torn down because of structural instability caused by the earthquake
some of the buildings are extremely hazardous assistant fire chief frank blackburn said
they are fourstory buildings above garages
all they had were vertical columns holding up the structures
if you picture a building sitting on columns with no lateral support on those columns when you get sideways motion the buildings slide left and right
blackburn said many residents are not going to be able to get their belongings out
if a big aftershock comes itll collapse he said
buildings collapsed like cakes without yeast
one fourthfloor apartment dweller stepped through her window onto the street after her building crumbled beneath her
the late mr robert maxwell liked to think of himself as a strong  chess player and there was always a chess set in his suite in his london headquarters
there is no evidence to suggest that maxwell actually was a strong player or that he played in any tournaments said mr malcolm pein international chess master and director of chess and bridge which yesterday took over the business and assets of maxwell macmillan chess and bridge
there may be doubts about robert maxwells strength as a player but less about his enthusiasm for the game
in  through the european newspaper he sponsored a section of the world chess championships in new york
and when pergamon was sold to elsevier last year maxwell kept the chess and bridge publishing businesses
mr pein said it had taken most of the year since mr maxwells death to prise the businesses which include chess monthly and bridge monthly from the administrators to the maxwell empire
price waterhouse took months and months to come up with any information about the company said mr pein
even when the new company had reached agreement to buy the business from price waterhouse administrator to the public maxwell companies they then ran into trouble with arthur andersen administrator to the private maxwell businesses
mr pein said the new company wanted to use and pay for the premises of maxwell macmillan chess and bridge  prefabricated buildings in the village of wheatley oxfordshire  until they found permanent premises
however he said that arthur andersen wanted two years back rent
despite the year of difficulties chess and bridge is now set up in new premises in euston road london
the company said it had the largest collection of chess and bridge books and products in the uk
in its renewed investigation of defense secretary nominee john tower the fbi is checking allegations that tower was recently involved in an episode of public drunkenness sources said friday  allegations that call into question his insistence that he has no current drinking problem
tower testified in confirmation hearings earlier this week that his problems with alcohol are behind him
but a senior member of the armed services committee who asked not to be identified said friday that the new allegation if true suggests that the former texas senators drinking problem may be ongoing and that his confirmation remains in doubt
the charge received wednesday by the committee was very specific giving the date and place of the alleged incident and was made by an informant who identified herself a knowledgeable source said
the episode allegedly occurred within the last year at the monocle a capitol hill restaurant frequented by lawmakers lobbyists and congressional aides
two other allegations under scrutiny by the fbis special inquiries unit which is working around the clock this weekend on the tower matter involve assertions of another incident of public intoxication and of a recent affair with an unidentified dallas woman
if the new charges should be verified by the fbi towers nomination is doomed an authoritative committee source said
fbi agents spent two hours at the monocle friday interviewing the owner the maitre d bartenders and waiters the times learned
the agents were told that tower when he was in the senate used to drink martinis
wine or tonic water but one source said that no one on the staff contradicted towers statement that in recent years he has moderated his onceheavy drinking and now drinks only an occasional glass of wine
in fact in recent weeks the staff told agents he often has ordered tonic water
none of the staff could recall any recent incident of improper behavior by tower at the restaurant sources said
on thursday the armed services committee had been set to approve the tower nomination but chairman sam nunn dga abruptly canceled the vote because of the new charges which he referred immediately to fbi director william s sessions
the bureau already had conducted an extensive background investigation of tower a year senate veteran who headed the armed services panel from  to 
when he nominated tower president bush said he was totally satisfied with the fbi check
no results until tuesday nunn said he did not expect the latest fbi inquiry to be completed until at least tuesday
tower friday refused to comment as he has throughout the confirmation inquiry
some tower supporters complain that committee democrats are turning the confirmation process into a circus for partisan political reasons
this is terribly cruel to a man whos just sort of hanging out there said committee member malcolm wallop rwyo
 a tower supporter
white house spokesman marlin fitzwater said that our feeling is simply that we believe he will be confirmed but that whenever there are any new concerns raised they need to be looked into
a senior white house staff member who asked not to be identified said administration officials were getting impatient with the delays in towers confirmation
everybody kind of wants to get our cabinet in the aide said
people want to see him confirmed and on the job
house armed services committee chairman les aspin dwis said that the controversy has already hobbled towers ability to lead the pentagon effectively
this whole nomination process is going to present a problem for him at the pentagon in terms of running the place aspin said
tower urged to withdraw and two influential defense industry trade magazines on monday will call for tower to withdraw from consideration for the pentagon post
in an editorial prepared for mondays issue defense news a trade paper widely read by defense contractors and on capitol hill says withdrawal is necessary because the record of mr towers professional life raises substantive doubt that he can perform with utmost effectiveness 
army times another prominent defense community publication says tower is unsuited for the defense department post because of his work as a consultant to defense contractors shortly after leaving government service in 
it said that the speed and greed with which tower spun through the revolving door between government and industry is appalling
tower has said that he was paid a total of more than  by six defense firms in the two years after leaving government service
towers profitable consulting work had raised concerns among a number of members of the armed services committee but did not appear to threaten his nomination
called morally unfit towers personal conduct however became an issue in the hearings on tuesday when conservative critic paul weyrich charged that the former senator was morally unfit for the post because of a history of drinking and womanizing
after a lengthy closed session in which tower was allowed to respond to weyrichs charges nunn asked the nominee publicly whether he had a problem with alcohol
i have none senator tower replied
i am a man of some discipline

rescuers searched through debris today for victims of an earthquake that ravaged onethird of this countrys territory and parts of india killing at least  people and injuring thousands
the death toll was expected to climb from sundays predawn quake on the indianepal border which triggered landslides and floods and was the mountainous regions deadliest in  years
officials in both countries said they had yet to receive reports from the remote himalayan areas hardest hit by the temblor which knocked out power and communications and was said to injure at least  people
niranjan thapa nepals minister of state for home affairs told a news conference at least  were dead and up to  injured
he said officials expected the numbers to climb
indian officials reported at least  people dead and more than  injured most by debris from collapsing buildings
the quake centered almost on the indianepal border registered  on the richter scale
indian television today showed the devastation in the indian state of bihar crumbled buildings makeshift morgues lined with rows of bodies wrapped in white shrouds damaged hospital wards packed with survivors
medical teams in india carried medicine and other supplies to overcrowded hospitals and the army was deployed to help search for victims
but the monsoons which hit the subcontinent in late june and usually last through september hampered relief operations
nepals thapa told a news conference that the rains have been a great hindrance in carrying out rescue works
access to some areas of this mountain country is impossible
he said  of the kingdoms  districts suffered extensive damage
the hardest hit appeared to be dharan a sparsely populated border region where thapa said at least  people died
bir bahadur shahi secretary of the home affairs ministry flew to eastern nepal on sunday
he said  to  houses were destroyed in the dharan district alone
ninety percent of the remaining houses are cracked shahi said adding that most of the damage was to modern houses of stone and older houses from mud and bricks
wooden houses were not affected he said
many people were given shelter in schools guesthouses and public buildings but most of the people do not want to leave their homes shahi said
he said water supplies were still adequate and there were no reports of disease breaking out
prime minister rajiv gandhi flew to bihar to tour some of the hardest hit areas
the government said it would release a detailed report after he returned to the capital tonight
prime minister marich man singh shrestha of nepal visited some of the victims at bir hospital in his capital katmandu
the quake roused people from their sleep in bihar and nine other indian states and central and eastern nepal
it lasted about a minute and aftershocks continued for about an hour
rail tracks sank into the soggy ground and bridges over rising rivers cracked paralyzing train service and road travel in many parts of the devastated areas
parts of northern bangladesh and the capital dhaka also felt the tremor
there were reports that  people were injured most by jumping from their houses during the quake
witnesses in darbhanga an indian city of  about  miles south of the epicenter said the only warnings were hissing sounds rattling doors and cracking windows
women began blowing conch shells following an ancient tradition believed to appease the weather gods
more than  houses were flattened in darbhanga as well as the districts of munger and madhubani indian officials said
in madhubani the bhootahi balan river jumped its banks and flooded nearly  villages
officials said at least  people died but it was not known whether the deaths were due to floods or collapsing houses
it was the worst quake to strike the region in  years
a temblor rumbled through the indian state of assam on the indiachina border in august 
official accounts said more than  people died but seismologists said their records showed  were killed
the richter scale is a gauge of energy released by an earthquake as measured by ground motion recorded on a seismograph
every increase of one number means the ground motion is  times greater

there was plenty of blame to go around at the end of the lengthy and traumatic mcmartin preschool molestation trial but no one was willing to accept it
in the nations longest and costliest trial raymond buckey and his mother peggy mcmartin buckey were acquitted thursday on  child molestation charges
the jury deadlocked on  other charges
afterward the district attorney who filed the case criticized the current district attorney
the current district attorney blamed his predecessor and defense attorneys
and some of the parents of children who attended the school blamed everybody
the system is not going to protect children said jackie mcgauley a parent who believes her child had been molested but didnt testify in the case
life is not fair said robert curry whose son attended the mcmartin school
i tell my children all the time  there is no such thing as fair
the district attorney who originally pursued the case said he would not have done anything differently
robert philibosian now in private practice angrily dismissed accusations that he played up the mcmartin case in   with the news media acting as eager accomplices  to boost his public profile as he ran for district attorney
i was a professional prosecutor for  years before this case was brought he said
to have people who know very little about professional or prosecutorial ethics to criticize me personally that i have some political motive is totally unjustified
philibosian instead pointed the finger at the man who defeated him current district attorney ira reiner
philibosian said reiner hurt prosecutors chances by dismissing charges against five of the original seven defendants and criticizing the case in a   minutes interview
but reiner calling his dismissal of charges for lack of evidence the decision were proud of said the trial took so long because of the states ponderous criminal justice system delay tactics by defense attorneys and a mess left behind by philibosian
this is a case i inherited reiner said
in interviews many jurors said they believed some of the children were molested but the prosecution never established that the defendants were responsible
even if you accept that the children were molested it didnt necessarily mean they were molested at the mcmartin preschool said juror brenda williams
weather forecasters today were offering droughtstricken farmers little prospect of relief in separate outlooks for the next  days and three months
a new climate assessment of the ongoing drought said many areas now experiencing extreme drought have less than a  percent chance of recovering from the drought within  months
the disappointing forecast came as president reagan headed to the midwest to inspect droughtplagued farms
on tuesday the agriculture department reported sharp declines in the outlook for several crops
that was followed wednesday by a day forecast from the national weather service saying that droughtstricken areas from the dakotas east to new york and from the canadian border to oklahoma arkansas and tennessee are likely to continue to be short of rain
that area which includes the major graingrowing states where crops already are suffering is given a  percent chance of less than normal rainfall
and some states in the center of the area stretching from west virginia to nebraska and from wisconsin to missouri may be even drier
they are given a  percent chance of being short of precipitation
a slice of southern california including los angeles is the driest area in the forecast with a  percent chance of having below normal rainfall
the rest of coastal california also will be dry the forecast said
the outlook also says theres a  percent chance of hotter than normal temperatures through the us heartland from new england to idaho and from the canadian border to oklahoma
within that area the chances of high temperatures are above  percent in wyoming while central midwestern states have a  percent chance of above average temperatures
wetter than normal weather is predicted for west and south texas and parts of new mexico arizona and utah
normal precipitation is forecast for the atlantic and gulf coast states along with the northwest and northern mountain states
the weather service said normal temperatures are expected for the atlantic states from virginia south and for the gulf coast states
west texas and new mexico may be cooler than normal but the far west is expected to see its normal quota of summer heat
the separate drought impact assessment issued by the national oceanic and atmospheric administrations climate office points out that predicting an end to the drought is a complex thing since dry spells have no normal lifetime
the low  percent probability of an end within  months is based simply on a statistical analysis of past droughts the agency said
the report noted that as of the end of june  percent of the continental united states was experiencing severe or extreme drought with parts of  states affected
that puts the current drought on the same level as the one in  but still less severe than the droughts of    and 
torrential thunderstorms sent a flash flood surging through a valley into this ohio river town killing at least  people leaving  missing and scores of others homeless friday authorities said
raging floodwaters late thursday swept homes off foundations and washed away cars
about  people were reported evacuated in central ohio
the valleys are choked with debris gov
richard celeste told reporters after flying over the hilly appalachian region in eastern ohio
a wall of water wiped a path through the area
the governor declared a state of emergency and dispatched about  national guardsmen to the area
the federal emergency management agency declared belmont county which includes shadyside and jefferson and franklin counties disaster areas making federal aid available to residents
seventeen counties now have been declared disaster areas because of flooding or tornadoes since may 
ten bodies were taken to the bauknecht funeral home in shadyside said bob bell funeral director
one body was taken to bellaire city hospital he said
chuck vogt belmont county coroners investigator also said there were  confirmed dead
earlier fire chief mark badia had said  adults and two children were dead
the names of the victims have not been released
county sheriff tom mccort who said he was running the recovery effort said  people in shadysville and meade township where the two creeks run south of the village were missing as of  pm
the list was compiled through telephone inquiries with townspeople and relatives and interviews with people evacuated from the area
about  people came and went from a shadyside disaster center during the day seeking news of missing friends and relatives
vogt said two bodies were found in the ohio river and one was found in a field next to the river after water receded
he said the rest were found in the creeks which flow into the river
some of the bodies were taken to a funeral home that set up a temporary morgue in shadyside about  miles south of wheeling wva officials from ohio west virginia and the us coast guard were searching the ohio river for survivors and bodies and badia said national guardsmen were to continue searching the creeks throughout the night
at least five houses along wegee creek were washed away and two cars were floating in water in one of the basements
anything that was still standing was covered with at least  feet of debris such as trees appliances and furniture
the national weather service issued no flood warning before the disaster although it did issue a flood watch said al wheeler deputy meteorologist in the bureaus cleveland office
weather service offices in cleveland akron columbus and pittsburgh showed the storm had diminished over eastern ohio when it had actually intensified wheeler said
thursday nights thunderstorms caused flash flooding across a wide area of central and eastern ohio northern west virginia and western pennsylvania
the floods closed roads damaged homes and forced hundreds of people to evacuate
but no place was hit with anything approaching the ferocity of the flooding in shadyside
about  inches of rain fell between  pm and  pm turning two ohio river tributaries outside the village of  people into dangerous torrents
about  buildings including a tavern were damaged along wegee creek and  buildings were hit by a flood along pipe creek four miles south of wegee creek said dick quinlin belmont county emergency services coordinator
part of the tavern was washed away when water caved in the back wall said judy phillips a sheriffs department spokeswoman
she said two patrons were accounted for but she could offer no estimate of how many were inside at the time
one man was found clinging to a bar stool said state sen robert ney whose district includes shadyside
ive never seen anything of this magnitude
there was no warning ney said
rescuers pulled people from three cars in wegee creek which flows through shadyside and into the ohio river said badia
i dont know how to describe it
 youve got to see it to believe it badia said
one resident robert ramsey said his wife rose was crushed to death in their house by the water
there was no complete accounting of deaths said karen bovek a spokeswoman at a shadyside fire department command center set up an a school
youre talking miles and miles of country roads that havent been gotten to yet she said
its a disaster here
there also was flooding in jefferson county north of belmont in licking county in central ohio and in northwestern west virginia and western pennsylvania
its a pretty good mess especially in the northern end of the county said clarence weston a dispatcher with the marshall county sheriffs department in moundsville wva we had  inches of rain in a twohour period last night
most of the problems in west virginia were confined to road closures and basement flooding
at least  people were evacuated during the night in the pittsburgh suburb of etna where some homes had up to  feet of water in their basements said borough manager bill skertich
they returned to their homes friday
landslides were reported in the pittsburgh area and many city streets were closed during the storm
the flooding was more serious in licking county ohio
wayne tresemer the countys disaster services director said water was standing up to  feet deep in some streets in the town of newark and the fire department and other agencies used boats to evacuate some residents
two inches of rain caused flooding in franklin county in central ohio and  inches of rain was dumped on holmes county in northcentral ohio the national weather service said
in jefferson county just north of belmont county in the eastern part of the state  to  residents were evacuated in adena where water was  to  feet deep in streets because of creek flooding
flood waters in most areas had subsided by thursday night according to authorities
andrei d sakharov the father of the soviet dissident movement finally received a  human rights award thursday night during his first trip to new york city
sakharov received the human rights award from the international league for human rights at a reception at the home of ronald lauder the former us ambassador to austria
the yearold nobel peace prize winner is on his first trip to the west less than two years after soviet leader mikhail gorbachev freed him from internal exile in the city of gorky
the human rights activist was banished in  to the closed city for opposing the soviet occupation of afghanistan
about  guests including author elie wiesel brooklyn district attorney elizabeth holtzman designer caroline roehm and abc televisions barbara walters attended the reception
the ceremony was closed to the media
sakharov wearing a blue beret and plaid scarf made no statement as he left the reception and entered a waiting limousine
sakharov is the honorary president of the league which has its headquarters in the united states and more than  affiliate groups around the world including the moscow human rights committee which sakharov and his colleagues founded in 
sakharov arrived in the united states on sunday to visit relatives and receive medical treatment before going to washington for a white house visit and a board meeting of the international foundation for the survival and development of humanity of which he is a director
this historic city has survived the ravages of earthquake battle and storm in its storied yearhistory but it faced perhaps its greatest test of all in hurricane hugo
the storm packing winds of up to  mph raged into charleston thursday night
this is a dangerous killer hurricane the likes of which few people who have lived all their lives in charleston have experienced warned mayor joseph p riley jr hugo was the first major hurricane to strike charleston since hurricane gracie came ashore  miles to the south in 
the seaside community has suffered through many disasters both natural and manmade
the worst in recent decades was in  when a tornado tore through the city killing  people injuring hundreds and causing an estimated  million in property damage
charleston a city of pastelcolored antebellum structures lining quaint streets and alleyways is where the civil war began in 
the city has survived the shot and shell of two wars and any number of smaller hurricanes politely referred to by charlestonians of refinement as september gales
but the worst natural disaster to beset the city occurred on the hot night of aug   when the ground rumbled in what some folks thought was a prelude to judgement day
the great charleston earthquake was felt as far away as chicago and new york city
measuring  on the richter scale of ground motion the earthquake claimed an estimated  lives destroyed  buildings and tossed most of the citys  chimneys into the streets
in recent years the city has attracted millions of visitors annually who tour its historic buildings and visit its nearby fine sand beaches
charleston has received international acclaim as home to spoleto festival usa founded by composer gian carlo menotti
organizers like to refer to spoleto as the worlds most comprehensive arts festival
actor gale gordon a sidekick of lucille ball from radio days who appeared with her in three television series recalled on wednesday how the comedian never thought of herself as particularly funny
oh but when she told a story or recalled an event that happened she always illustrated it with her body and her face the yearold gordon said in a telephone interview
she never saw it but she was extremely amusing
gordon who is appearing in a play in edmonton spent the day in an edmonton hotel room mourning the death of lucille ball in a los angeles hospital wednesday at age  and quietly remembering his funny friend
the world will miss her greatly the actor said
i personally will remember her as the best talent of her kind in the world  a wonderful warm friend and a bit of a genius  the only one ive ever really known
in his first television series alongside miss ball gordon was the flustered banker mr mooney in the lucy show from 
the next six years saw him as harrison carter on heres lucy
they were reunited briefly in  for the shortlived life with lucy
gordon first met miss ball in  on the radio program my favorite husband which later became i love lucy on television
i thought she was a very goodlooking young woman and very talented he recalled
she was very pleasant to work with
none of us knew what was going to happen  television was very young then and it wasnt taken too seriously
we never dreamed it would ever become the power it was  and the great stars it would produce
gordon last spoke to miss ball from edmonton on his birthday feb  when she called to wish me a happy birthday as she has done for years and years
gordon has done regular stints for years at a chain of edmontonbased dinner theatres called stage west
he is currently appearing with that companys mayfair dinner theatre as a priest in the play mass appeal
the play has another month to run and gordon says that means he wont be able to attend miss balls funeral
i couldnt do that because it would put people out of work he said
she would be the first one to scream her head off if i did that
supercomputers satellites and the expertise of several hurricane forecasters predicted the destructive path hurricane hugo would follow giving people plenty of time to flee the south carolina coast
but hurricane tracking remains an uncertain science
forecasters at the national hurricane center used computer models to track hugos path into charleston sc all the worlds knowledge about meteorological conditions and forecasting changes in those conditions is embodied in those models said thomas pyke head of national oceanic and atmospheric administrations satellite service
pinpointing the exact point of hugos landfall was difficult but forecasters said friday that the landfall was predicted in time for evacuation
overall i think the tracking models gave us a very good idea where hugo would be so officials in south carolina could act in a timely manner said research meteorologist colin mcadie
the real forecasting problem with hugo was predicting the intensity of the storm which was upgraded to a category  hurricane just hours before it slammed into charleston
it is very difficult to predict changes in intensity because we dont have very reliable computer models for that mcadie said
we really need to improve on our forecasting ability of strength
the hurricane specialists were surprised by the lastminute increase in wind speed which was reported to them by air force reconnaissance
hurricane specialist gil clark who has tracked hurricanes for  years said that a couple of decades ago the only forecasting tools were reports from aircraft or ships
we had no radar or satellites then so needless to say our forecasts were less accurate clark said
in the late s the weather service began using satellites to obtain a global weather picture
information from the satellite is used to improve the accuracy of the largescale models that television viewers see every night
using the information from the satellite supercomputers at the national meteorological center in suitland md send information to the hurricane center where a tracking model constantly changes to account for current weather conditions and the position of the hurricane
to determine the track of the storm the forecasters analyze supercomputer predictions satellite data the history of similar storms and the current path of the hurricane
then they make an educated guess about the landfall
meteorology professor kerry a emmanuel of the massachussetts institute of technology criticizes the current forecasting system
congress and the american people are suffering from the collective delusion that our data problems have been solved by satellites and that just isnt true emmanuel said
satellites can give a pretty picture he said but not enough information about the wind and temperatures that affect a hurricanes path
most of the information actually used to predict hurricanes comes from flying airplanes into the hurricane and they do a very good job emmanuel said
forecasters say the accuracy of satellite pictures is improving every year so longrange forecasting should become more precise
we have to remember that those models used are only guidance products pyke said and that its ultimately the job of the forecaster to predict the storms path
cut to a row of dour communists in illfitting gray suits announcing gorbachevs illness and a palace coup
the camera zooms in on the impassive faces of the two men last seen in gorbachevs office
 what is going on here
 ok its a hackneyed device that would only work in the movies
but then this weeks events in the soviet union have all the makings of a spy thriller
 kremlinologists who dabble in conspiracy theories are working overtime though they insist that their darkest imaginings be clearly labeled pure speculation
 once you have a palace coup the possibilities are endless said robert conquest a senior research fellow at the hoover institution
russian politics are full of very strange things
 for all we know conquest joked gorbachev could be injected with drugs to change his personality or kgb scientists could produce a bodydouble to impersonate him
 his friends would know but would you or i
conquest said
that would be going a bit far
 a more intriguing scenario has gorbachev conspiring with the coup plotters to engineer a transformation of the soviet political landscape
the thinking goes like this with his popularity at rock bottom gorbachev a lifelong creature of the kgb hatches a false coup in order to step out of the way while hardliners and liberals battle each other
the coup falls apart and gorbachev triumphantly returns with a level of legitimacy he never enjoyed before
 the theory could explain the apparent bungling of the coup plotters said author joseph finder whose  novel the moscow club foreshadowed many of the elements of the current crisis
 finder who said he did not subscribe to the scenario nonetheless pointed out that tanks did not begin to roll until hours after gorbachevs supposed arrest
russian president boris yeltsin was not arrested and leningrad was left alone
 speculation was not unique to kremlin watchers in the united states
 theorizing was rampant in the streets of moscow on tuesday said san francisco businesswoman kimberly getto who sent a long fax detailing speculation fueled by the fact that many of the tanks encircling the russian parliament building had no ammunition
gorbachev did not want bloodshed according to the theory
 the democratic reform movement headed by former foreign minister eduard shevardnadze gorbachevs longtime ally floated the same possibility in a statement monday
 its highly implausible but not to be excluded that gorbachev himself agreed to a withdrawal thinking hed show them they still needed him said norman naimark director of stanfords center for russian and east european studies
the degree of connivance is difficult to gauge
you would obviously expect mr tower to say no and he obliges volubly and passionately
if that was all there was to consequences we could scan the dust jacket and invest our savings in local real estate
consequences reads a bit like a political stephen king story as the small senator swelled into a beltway monster
politics never has been for the squeamish but the tower controversy leaves a much more disagreeable taste than did the senators caperings which mostly took place in the s anyway
were the writing less stiff and the narrative technique less choppy consequences might have been a classic case study of late thcentury politics out of control
given mr towers qualifications for the job  intelligence patriotism and past chairmanship of the armed services committee  the nomination should have sailed through with flying colors
instead it sank like the bismarck
clearly and apparently to his surprise mr tower had made many enemies since his arrival in washington in  often rubbing even supporters the wrong way
the senator from the lone star state could be lordly in his englishcut suits
once meeting with the editors of my newspaper which had backed him strongly he thought nothing of tilting back in his chair crossing his tiny wellshod feet atop the conference table
when the tower hearings opened all manner of accusations came to public notice
the new right activist paul weyrich claimed to have seen the senator consorting with a lady not his wife
it was reported that mr tower had chased a secretary around his desk and had fondled women at bergstrom air force base
the second wife whom the senator had recently divorced possessed a repertory of tales she cheerfully volunteered
at his hotel mr tower was accorded that doubtful tribute to instantcelebrity status the media stakeout
the nominee issued fervent denials he drank only wine having long since sworn off scotch hed never chased secretaries his services for defenseindustry clients had been proper and modest
none of the charges at least on mr towers showing proved to have the least substance
no use
dirt is dirtier than purity is pure as one of john oharas characters observes
sen sam nunn mr towers successor as armed services committee chairman seemed initially to smile on the nomination then the rumor mill started churning and he changed fronts
while endeavoring to look statesmanlike sen nunn leaned on moderate democrats who would otherwise have supported tower
sen nunn made the campaign personal says mr tower  vote for me or vote for him
most democrats in the end went with sen nunn
morality
mr tower suggests instead that sen nunn a presidential hopeful discovered and seized an opportunity to show who was really no
 on national defense
sen nunn had every reason to know that the moral and ethical charges leveled at mr tower and investigated exhaustively by the fbi were flimsy
yet he waved them about anyway
when the media retailed lurid and unsubstantiated stories sen nunn pursed his lips like a georgia sundayschool superintendent and suggested that a drunken mr tower might accidentally press the nuclear button
sam nunn mr tower insists used the fbi inquiries to discredit me and to strike at the president of the united states
the essential chain of good judgment and goodwill broke down during my confirmation process
sen nunn has company on mr towers dishonor roll
there is sen ernest hollings a study in arrogance and pomposity sen james exon one of the most excessive regular boozers in the senate and nbcs andrea mitchell the most viciously partisan reporter ive ever seen along with the washington press corps
sen john warner a republican is depicted as falling all over himself to stay in good with sen nunn
mr tower feels not without reason that he was arraigned on morals charges by cynical colleagues and media personages whom no one ever mistook for southern baptist deacons
i dont so much resent my rejection by the senate mr tower insists as the way it was done
tower you were lynched mike wallace the cbs correspondent told him
worse yet the lynch mob remains at large

strikes by tens of thousands of miners in this siberian coal region spread to four more of the soviet unions coal fields tass reported today
the official news agency said coal miners in vorkuta in the far north the don river city of rostov in southwestern russia and the ukrainian industrial center of dnepropetrovsk walked out wednesday
miners in the karaganda region in soviet central asia today refused to work tass said
by evening  mines in the region home of the countrys thirdlargest coal fields were reported at a standstill
tass said their demands were similar to those of striking miners in the donetsk and kuznetsk coal basins who are seeking greater local control over their industries and better wages and living conditions
kuznetsk in western siberia and donetsk in the ukraine are the countrys two leading coal basins and the strikes amount to the countrys worst labor unrest since the s
novokuznetsk is a major city in the kuznetsk region where the strikes began  days ago
the government has acknowledged that living and working conditions for miners in the regions are abysmal and has made general pledges of improvements
tass reported wednesday that some miners in siberia had returned to work after the government made pay concessions
the government also has promised to send extra meat butter sugar tea leather shoes furniture and cars to relieve shortages in the region the communist youth league newspaper komsomolskaya pravda said today
but the newspaper and tass reported more disturbances in the ukraine
komsomolskaya pravda quoted a communist official in the donetsk city of makeyevka as saying the scale of the strike is growing
practically all the coal enterprises of the city have stopped work
miners in vorkuta rostov and dnepropetrovsk all walked off the job on wednesday tass said
in vorkuta strikers sent a letter to the kremlin asking for an urgent resolution of the sharp economic and social problems of the coal sector and also specific problems of workers of the far north tass said
in rostov miners economic demands included extra pay for evening and night shifts longer vacations and an increase in the price of coal to world market prices the news agency reported
in dnepropetrovsk which is  miles from donetsk workers demands mirrored those of donetsk and kuznetsk miners
in karaganda strikers said they walked out to protest incomplete news accounts of miners demands in the kuznetsk strikes according to tass
president mikhail s gorbachev said wednesday the strikes could imperil his reforms and that there were reports of railway workers being urged to strike
he said that if labor trouble spreads we may have to take such extreme measures that it will hurt what weve been doing to overhaul the economy through greater attention to freemarket mechanisms
he did not elaborate
strikes are rare in the soviet union and were ended by force before gorbachev gained power in march 
tass today said that the kuznetsk strike had reached a turning point with nine out of  mining centers back at work
it was not known how many more employees were back on the job today
on wednesday tass said that  strikers in kuznetsk were back at work and  remained on strike
state television said wednesday that the strike in the donetsk basin had spread to  of its  mines more than triple the previous number and that mine construction workers had joined
in a report from the donetsk city of yenakiyevo television said steel and cokechemical plants were on the verge of a stoppage for lack of coal
earlier reports in the official press had said operations at steel and power plants were affected by short supplies of coal and coke
gorbachev told the national legislature wednesday that the strikes had deprived the nation of more than  million tons of coal
the government has agreed to most miner demands including those on pensions and overtime gorbachev said
but he said that settling some longerterm issues would take up to a month
tass outlined a concessions package that includes bonus pay to night shifts and for men using jackhammers
strikers also have complained about poor housing and shortages of consumer goods and food and the government has made general pledges of improvements in those areas
iraqi president saddam hussein seemed determined to solve his financial problems and fulfill territorial ambitions by dethroning the government of neighboring kuwait
the invasion unprecedented in modern arab history reflected the brutality saddam has used to crush all opposition at home since coming to power in 
the sentence for criticizing saddam is death and the president considered kuwaits oil overproduction and the subsequent fall in the price of oil a personal affront to iraq
iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living
oh god almighty be witness that we have warned them he said last month after prices tumbled below  per barrel
he accused kuwait and the united arab emirates of costing iraq  billion in lost oil revenue by ignoring their quotas assigned by the organization of petroleum exporting countries
he also accused kuwait of stealing  billion by pumping oil from a disputed field that straddled their border and demanded that kuwait write off an estimated  billion it loaned iraq during the persian gulf war
saddam was reported to be incensed that kuwait was demanding repayment for the wartime loans
saddam said he fought the war to protect the arabs from the fundamentalist revolution fomented by the late ayatollah ruhollah khomeini in persian mainly shiite moslem iran
never mind that iraq started the war in  by invading iran after a series of border skirmishes along the shattalarab waterway iraqs only outlet to the gulf
despite claims that the war was an unprecedented victory the long conflict stalled iraqs development dragging on for eight years
it has still not formally ended
the war bills kept the government from delivering material benefits promised to the iraqi people directly after the war
the  budget slashed funds for imports and iraqis were told to brace for another year of austerity
private investment has failed to take hold
iraq ended the war an estimated  billion in debt
its main gulf port of basra is still blocked and its oil infrastructure damaged
tens of thousands of iraqi prisoners of war languish in iranian prisons and an estimated  iraqis were killed or wounded
despite its puny size kuwaits oil reserves almost match iraqs  billion barrels
by controlling kuwait saddam could help solve the financial hangover from the persian gulf war and fulfill iraqs longstanding wish for more gulf coastline
iraqs  troops massed at the border in the past few weeks were believed part of a pressure campaign to make kuwait capitulate to iraqs demands
but kuwaits pledge two weeks ago to obey new opec quotas and saddams promise to egyptian president hosni mubarak that he would not invade lulled the arab world into the sense the crisis was over
homage to the cause of arab unity has been paramount in middle east politics since postwar independence from colonial powers
although a civil war in yemen in the s brought egyptian and saudi arabian intervention on opposing sides no arab state has ever directly deposed the government of a fellow arab league member
despite iraqi claims that it is helping internal opposition liberate kuwait it has long coveted the tiny emirate
the iraqi government refused to recognize its independence in  and threatened to attack then but backed down when britain landed troops in kuwait
the invasion shook kuwaits neighbors along the gulf
it proved the decadeold gulf cooperation council that groups saudi arabia bahrain qatar the united arab emirates oman and kuwait was toothless
the gcc did not issue a statement much less implement its mutual defense treaty
while iraq was unlikely to invade saudi arabia it could use the precedent of kuwait to browbeat its neighbors on local policy issues
bombing an oil field would be a sufficient reminder of what happened to kuwait when it balked at iraqi demands
also in a region entirely ruled by absolute monarchs the fall of one makes the rest feel extremely vulnerable
in a series of bellicose statements in recent months saddam has sought to focus domestic attention outside iraq
in march he threatened to burn half of israel with iraqs chemical weapons  banned under international law  if iraq was attacked
it was a popular stance among arabs frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace and a palestinian nation in the arabisraeli conflict
then britain arrested several people on charges they were smuggling nuclear triggers into baghdad
weeks later police in europe impounded what they said was parts to a supergun capable of firing chemical or nuclear shells into israel
saddam cried foul claiming the west was trying to wreck the scientific progress of the arabs
saddam has sought to inherit the mantle of the late egyptian president gamal abdel nassar as the leader of the arab world
his relentless personality cult has dubbed him the knight of the arabs
for kuwait on thursday he was a dark knight
asked the reason for the invasion kuwaits ambassador to washington sheik saud nasir alsabah said at a news conference ambition
hegemony
control of the whole area
there is not any reason for it
the death toll from the himalayan earthquake topped  on wednesday as rescue workers hampered by monsoon rains aftershocks and washed out roads reached remote areas of nepal and found more bodies
in eastern india which also was devastated by the quake cracks were found in the embankments of six rivers in bihar state and officials said floods could pose the next threat to the  million people

at least  people died and  were injured in both countries sunday when the earthquake jolted the mountainous indianepal border region
it was the deadliest quake to strike the subcontinent since  when by official count  people were killed in the eastern indian state of assam
indian officials said wednesday that at least  died in india in sundays disaster
officials in nepal said at least  people were killed in nepal including  people whose bodies were found in remote areas on wednesday
in indias bihar state officials said the water had reached dangerous levels and was still rising in six rivers the ganges the ghagara the burigandak the bagmati the koshi and the mahananada
to make matters worse survey teams found cracks in the embankments of the six rivers which are swollen by monsoon rains that began in late june
engineers tried to strengthen the weakened embankments with cement and helicopters made aerial surveys watching for ruptures
as survivors in both countries began rebuilding homes damaged or destroyed by the quake medicine food and financial aid began arriving from abroad
elroy j carlson an official at the us embassy in katmandu said the united state offered  in aid
in new delhi us
ambassador john gunther dean presented the government with a similar amount for indian victims
michael hamilton an official at the british embassy in katmandu said three medical teams had been sent to dharan
the teams are carrying two truckloads of blood and medicine hamilton said
the british army also runs a military hospital in dharan where at least  people were admitted
the government hospital in dharan treated hundreds of people injured when brick and wood houses collapsed
un agencies and the red cross also sent medical teams to nepal and the government began distributing pound bags of rice
the relief efforts were hampered in both countries by heavy rains which cut off communications and road links to several of the affected areas
the earthquake hit a wide area and it is a big job to reach the remote villages
but we are trying said mittal the relief official in bihar state
as the value of the rouble plunges and potential foreign investors worry about a host of obstacles to investing in russia russian officials had several reasons yesterday to feel thankful for mcdonalds hamburgers
opening the second mcdonalds restaurant in moscow along with a storey office block mr george cohon head of mcdonalds canada could well be described as the russian authorities idea of a model investor
mcdonalds proven determination to be here for the long term and to serve russians in their own currency as opposed to the dollars charged by most other foreign joint ventures are just a couple of reasons for russian gratitude
mr viktor khlystun the agriculture minister praised the fact that mcdonalds gets most of its supplies from inside russia after setting up a dollars m processing plant outside moscow
he also thanked mcdonalds for providing jobs a model of western standards for the countrys decrepit service industry and finally for what he described as the most delicious food
but despite the jolly opening ceremony  with big macs musicians playing the balalaika and hundreds of yellow balloons forming a giant m  life has been tough for mcdonalds since it opened its first restaurant in moscow   years ago
although the first moscow restaurant is the busiest mcdonalds in the world the plunging rouble high inflation and constantly changing tax rules have been a challenge to mcdonalds management who admitted that they have no idea of when it could recoup its initial dollars m investment
it will depend on how rapidly we can open new restaurants what happens to the rouble what happens to raw materials that we buy
we dont have an estimate of how long it will take
there are too many variables said mr cohon
apart from housing the restaurant on the ground floor the mcdonalds office block is rented out to western companies in an attempt to generate hard currency alongside the mountains of roubles made from selling hamburgers
in the  months since he walked free from prison nelson mandela has played the chief role in talks with president fw
de klerk and the white government
he has presided over an african national congress divided and not yet organized for politics
he has spent his moral capital trying unsuccessfully to end the murderous conflict between black political factions
 now mandela is confronted with his wifes conviction for a brutal criminal offense
he has loyally defended her innocence
he has seemed to hear no voice to the contrary
but events have caught up
 the radicals in the anc may well use the trial and conviction of mrs mandela to arouse members against nelson mandelas policy of peace and negotiation
 there are rumors that at a national conference next month the radicals will try to move such older leaders as mandela and walter sisulu aside to a nominal senior role
 it is a gloomy picture an elderly man bearing the hopes of peace in south africa beset by problems personal trauma on top of political
but i think it would be wrong to conclude that the south african drama is necessarily heading toward a tragic end
 one reason for a degree of optimism is the way south africans on all sides most of them have dealt with winnie mandelas trial calmly and fairly
 during the years of white supremacy the law has been viciously misused
but from all one can tell this trial was handled professionally by the judge justice michael stegmann
 the reaction to the verdict and sixyear prison sentence was also mild
surprisingly few supporters gathered outside the court to cheer mrs mandela
the anc issued a detached statement saying that the last word had not been spoken in the case
archbishop desmond tutu said the movement is larger than any individual
 a more fundamental reason for hope is that fw
de klerk and nelson mandela  and those for whom they speak  have a common interest in creating a new nonracial south africa
they need each other
without their agreement there can be no solution no outcome that leaves a viable country
 the next step is formal negotiations
they can come only when the government takes further steps to meet the reasonable anc demand for action against violence  in particular a ban on the carrying of socalled cultural weapons such as spears
how can the government look away when  zulus carrying spears and machetes slaughter township residents
 the time factor is crucial now
negotiations must start soon if the moderate center of the public black and white is to retain hope for a peaceful solution
world and time press on nelson mandela
